scaleAge_TAL: Estimated age of scales by TAL reader
scaleAge_DHO: Estimated age of scales by DHO reader
scaleAge: Estimated consensus age of scales

NOTES:
* Only small number of scales were read by both readers (NAs shown for all scaleAge variables that were not aged).
* Several otoliths were removed because unreadable or unuseable (most are not shown in the data file, but some are shown with NAs for all three otoAge variables).

VARIABLES:
Fish_ID: Identification number unique to each fish
Structure: Calcified structure type (scales; otoliths; cleithra (whole and section); and anal, dorsal, pectoral, pelvic fin rays)
Cory: Estimated age of the structure by Cory reader
Emily: Estimated age of the structure by Emily reader
Mike: Estimated age of the structure by Mike reader
Rin: Estimated age of the structure by Rin reader
Mean age: Mean age of the structure across all readers
MAD: Mean absolute deviation of the structure across all readers
CV: Coefficient of variation of the structure across all readers

NOTES:
* Mean age, MAD, and CV variables are not needed in our analyses.

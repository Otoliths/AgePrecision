Overall percent agreement between readers ranged from 91\% to 98\% for otoliths compared with 38\% to 67\% for scales and spines. Disagreement rates associated with scales and spines increased as fish grew older. Average percent error between readers was about an order of magnitude higher for scales and spines than for otoliths. Ages estimated from scales and spines progressively decreased as age increased based on otolith examination. The use of scales and spines to age largemouth bass, smallmouth bass, yellow perch and brown bullheads from the northeastern US was less precise and will likely lead to underestimation of age of larger and older fish.},

Age determined from digitised pictures was generally higher than that determined by using a stereomicroscope. This was particularly true for older specimens. For some individuals a change in the zoning pattern in the otoliths was observed. The occurrence of these changes was not closely correlated with the visually determined maturation index. For fish of similar size otolith radius was correlated with age. The growth rate also influenced otolith morphology.

The purpose of this programme is to assure, to the greatest extent possible, that ages used in stock assessment are based on consistent ageing criteria. This age data is entered into our AGEDATA Microsoft ACCESS™ database where it can be easily updated, corrected and analysed. VISUAL BASIC computer programmes AGREE (a precision estimating programme) and RANGES (an outlier searching programme) were written to routinely analyse age data before data are released to end-users. The statistical relationship between average percentage error and coefficient of variation is described, as well as an interpretation of Bowker’s test for symmetry. Discrepancies between the reader and tester are reconciled while viewing the problematic otoliths using a dual-headed microscope, and reconciled ages are assigned.

We evaluated the precision and accuracy of a non-lethal ageing method for goliath grouper Epinephelus itajara, listed as critically endangered on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. Paired finray and otolith samples (n = 21) were collected opportunistically from fish that had died primarily from red tide or hypothermal events in Florida coastal waters. Finray ageing proved relatively precise (coefficient of variation [CV] = 4.24\%), although less so than otolith ageing (CV = 1.45\%). Finray ages agreed with otolith ages the majority of the time (CV = 3.15\% and concordance correlation coefficient = 0.991) for E. itajara from 0 to 18 yr of age. Based on a test of symmetry, finray ageing was also relatively unbiased for fish up to 18 yr of age. Further evaluation of any limitations of the method will depend on obtaining more samples, especially from larger, presumably older, fish. Clearly, the non-lethal finray ageing method can be used as an alternative to using otoliths for goliath grouper at least up to 18 yr of age. Finray ageing could significantly reduce the need to sacrifice protected E. itajara to assess their population recovery.},

The aims of this study were to investigate the accuracy and precision of age estimates from transverse sections of sagittal otoliths and to assess effects on these of the geographic area of collection and otolith preparation method. Two independent validation studies suggested an approximately annual formation of annuli in otoliths, predominantly for otoliths with 4–10 annuli but also for one otolith with 29 annuli. Otolith sections produced exceptionally high annulus counts: up to 56 annuli for samples from the Great Barrier Reef (GBR), Australia; and up to 55 annuli from the Seychelles, indicating a high longevity for this species. The precision of otolith readings from the GBR (index of average percent error, IAPE=3.21±0.26 S.E.) was within commonly accepted bounds for age estimation (IAPE up to 5\%) but precision of readings from the Seychelles was significantly lower (IAPE=9.18±0.47 S.E.) and outside of this “acceptable” range. Age-based biological parameters for red bass from the Seychelles should thus be applied with greater caution than those for red bass from the GBR. If basic demographic properties are assumed relatively constant across the wide geographic range sampled, however, results from the GBR could be used as more reliable preliminary data for precautionary management strategies in the Seychelles and elsewhere.},

Otoliths and dorsal spines were collected from 302 walleye considered known age in the Winnebago System, Wisconsin, USA: 142 that were assigned ages via progression of discrete length modes following an individual strong year class (ages 0–3), and 160 (ages 4–10, 12–13, 16, 18) that were initially tagged at lengths small enough to accurately assign age ±1 year ({\textless}380mm) and later recaptured and assigned an age (assigned age at tagging plus number of years at liberty). Paired aging structures were also collected from over 2000 additional walleye sampled during spawning assessments, tournament monitoring, and other surveys to better understand the relationship between spine and otolith age estimates and to compare catch curve residuals from structure and sex-specific catch curves to standard walleye recruitment indices. We found otoliths were accurate for walleye ages 0–10, while dorsal spines yielded relatively accurate age estimates for walleye ages 1–5, but underestimated age of walleye age-6 and older. Age distributions within catch curves constructed from otolith age estimates correlated well with measured year class strength, while age distributions from dorsal spine age estimates correlated poorly. Our results from fish considered known age validate the accuracy of otolith age estimates for walleye up to age-10, with corroborating evidence from catch curves and accurate recruitment indices strongly suggesting that otoliths are valid for all ages of Winnebago System walleye. We recommend the use of otoliths to accurately estimate walleye age, growth, and mortality, and to provide accurate age data for other population analyses.},

In C. batrachus, otoliths showed the highest (92.9 \%) agreement between readers followed by vertebrae (87 \%) and pectoral spines (83.8 \%). The highest percentage of agreement (87 \%) and lowest average percentage of error (1.89 \%) and coefficient of variation (3.81 \%) values were observed between otoliths and vertebrae age estimates. In H. fossilis, vertebrae showed the clearest annual rings and had highest (90.8 \%) PA values between readers, followed by otoliths (80.3 \%) and pectoral spines (73.7 \%). The highest PA and lowest APE and CV values were found between vertebrae and otoliths estimates. In W. attu, otoliths showed the highest PA (86.7 \%) values between readers followed by pectoral spines (70.3 \%) and vertebrae (67.9 \%). The highest PA and lowest APE and CV values were found between otoliths and pectoral spines. On account of the highest PA, lowest APE and CV values, the most suitable ageing structure was otolith in C. batrachus and W. attu, while vertebrae in H. fossilis. If mean age estimates are considered then in the absence of the most suitable ageing structure, alternatively, vertebrae can be used in C. batrachus, otoliths in H. fossilis and pectoral spines in W. attu.},

	abstract = {Dermal denticles are useful tools in taxonomic and phylogenetic studies focusing Chondrichthyes. In particular, Rajidae species can be differentiated, among other characteristics, by the number, disposition and morphology of these structures along the dorsal surface. Three types of dermal denticles can be defined: prickles, thorns and bucklers. The first ones are found all over the body, while, the remaining are present on restricted body locations. On a recent work, caudal thorns were successfully used for ageing rays and skates from Falkland Islands, but seemed inappropriate to age Atlantic species. The present paper analyses different types of denticles from the caudal region of Raja clavata, using specimens caught in Portuguese waters, with total length ranging from 13 to 89 cm. Denticles from each group were further analyzed for ageing purposes. The distance from the centrum origin to the distal edge of each growth band and the band width were measured. Following preestablished criteria on ageing reproducibility, thorns were selected and ages were assigned for each sampled specimen. Ageing precision was compared between thorns and vertebral centra. According to statistical measures thorns revealed to be more precise. Von Bertalanffy growth model was adjusted to age-at-length data: L∞= 130.5 cm, k= 0.10 year-1 and t0= -0.14 year. Although females attain larger sizes than males, no statistical differences were observed on growth rates between sexes.},

	abstract = {Quality issues in fish age estimation, which historically have focused mainly on inadequacies in the validation process, are increasingly directed at ways to measure and control the errors or inconsistencies in the application of established and validated methods. The process of age estimation, as undertaken by human operators, involves a complex mix of pattern recognition and interpretation based on knowledge and experience. It is best characterised as a skill rather than an art. Such an approach promotes the use of well-recognised techniques designed to maintain and enhance skills that also assist in maintaining standards. The results of a questionnaire completed by representatives of over 50 ageing laboratories worldwide were used to assess current quality assurance and quality control practices. Results indicate a great diversity in attention to, and no clear consensus on desirable standards for, quality issues, including staff training, use of reference sets, reading protocols, and post-reading analyses. This is considered more likely to reflect variation in awareness of the importance of quality issues than variation in the need for quality assurance and quality control measures. Greater attention to a range of quality control processes is urged, particularly the more regular use of reference sets.},

	abstract = {The European barbel Barbus barbus L. is considered a ‘flag’ species for river conservation and sport fishing, but it is increasingly threatened in its native range of distribution. To provide accurate age estimates during early life for appropriate management and conservation measures, the bias and precision of otolith (daily) micro-increment counts were evaluated and age determinations validated on laboratory-reared embryos and larvae. Out of the three pairs of otoliths, the lapillus and sagitta provided reliable age estimates for free embryos and larvae up to 17 days of (known) age post-fertilisation, with first micro-increment formation occurring five days postfertilisation. On the other hand, micro-increments on asterisci formed only 16–17 days post-fertilisation. There was agreement in microincrement counts based on lapilli and sagittae, but not between interpreters, indicating that despite consistency between the two pairs of otoliths extensive training and experience are required for reliable age interpretation. The ability to estimate the ages of 0+ B. barbus from their otoliths will contribute to a better understanding of growth rates from both hatchery-stocked and native/introduced cohorts.},

	abstract = {Age-reading error occurs when estimates of age based on reading hard structures differ from the true age of the animal concerned. This error needs to be accounted for when conducting stock assessments. Common methods for quantifying age-reading error include the average percent error, the coefficient of variation, age bias plots, and age difference tables, but these techniques cannot be used to construct age-reading error matrices. A method for constructing age-reading error matrices that accounts for both ageing bias and ageing imprecision is outlined. Simulation evaluation of this method suggests that it is able to estimate both ageing bias (assuming that one reader is unbiased) and ageing imprecision for relatively large sample sizes and for the ages that constitute the bulk of the ages in the sample. However, the performance of the method is poor when sample sizes are small, age-reading error is correlated among readers, when both readers are biased, and for ages that are poorly represented in the sample. The method is applied for illustrative purposes to data on multiple-aged fish in Australia’s southern and eastern scalefish and shark fishery. Re´sume´ : Les erreurs de lecture de l’aˆge se produisent lorsque les estimations de l’aˆge base´es sur la lecture de structures dures diffe`rent de l’aˆge re´el de l’animal en question. Il est ne´cessaire de tenir compte de cette erreur dans les e´valuations de stocks. Les me´thodes courantes pour quantifier l’erreur de lecture de l’aˆge comprennent le pourcentage moyen d’erreur, le coefficient de variation, les graphiques d’erreur en fonction de l’aˆge et les tables de diffe´rences d’aˆge, mais ces me´thodes ne peuvent pas servir a` contruire des matrices d’erreurs de lecture de l’aˆge. Nous de´crivons une me´thode pour contruire des matrices d’erreurs de lecture de l’aˆge qui tiennent compte autant de l’erreur que de l’impre´cision de la de´termination de l’aˆge. Une e´valuation de la me´thode par simulation indique qu’elle est capable d’estimer tant l’erreur de la lecture d’aˆge (si on suppose qu’un des lecteurs n’est pas biaise´) que l’impre´cision de la de´termination d’aˆge pour des e´chantillons de taille relativement e´leve´e et pour les aˆges qui constituent la majorite´ des aˆges dans l’e´chantillon. Cependant, la performance de la me´thode est me´diocre lorsque l’e´chantillon est petit, lorsqu’il y a corre´lation de l’erreur de lecture entre les lecteurs, lorsque les deux lecteurs sont biaise´s et pour les aˆges qui sont peu repre´sente´s dans l’e´chantillon.},

Strong 2003 and 2009 year-classes, along with the 2005 year-class, were also evident based on distinct modes of age-1 ﬁsh ({\textless}110 mm) in the length frequency distributions from 2004, 2010, and 2006, respectively. Modes from these year-classes were present as progressively larger ﬁsh in subsequent years. Few to no age-1 ﬁsh ({\textless}110 mm) were present in all other years.

  abstract = {The Alaska Fisheries Science Center operates a 14-person Age and Growth Program that specialises in the ageing of various groundfish species using otoliths. In 1983, a quality control programme was established whereby a random subsample of 20\% of the total of aged samples is re-aged by a second age reader. The purpose of this programme is to assure, to the greatest extent possible, that ages used in stock assessment are based on consistent ageing criteria. This age data is entered into our AGEDATA Microsoft ACCESS\texttrademark{} database where it can be easily updated, corrected and analysed. VISUAL BASIC computer programmes AGREE (a precision estimating programme) and RANGES (an outlier searching programme) were written to routinely analyse age data before data are released to end-users. The statistical relationship between average percentage error and coefficient of variation is described, as well as an interpretation of Bowker's test for symmetry. Discrepancies between the reader and tester are reconciled while viewing the problematic otoliths using a dual-headed microscope, and reconciled ages are assigned. When necessary, all questionable otoliths in a troublesome sample may be re-aged.},

  abstract = {Age-reading error occurs when estimates of age based on reading hard structures differ from the true age of the animal concerned. This error needs to be accounted for when conducting stock assessments. Common methods for quantifying age-reading error include the average percent error, the coefficient of variation, age bias plots, and age difference tables, but these techniques cannot be used to construct age-reading error matrices. A method for constructing age-reading error matrices that accounts for both ageing bias and ageing imprecision is outlined. Simulation evaluation of this method suggests that it is able to estimate both ageing bias (assuming that one reader is unbiased) and ageing imprecision for relatively large sample sizes and for the ages that constitute the bulk of the ages in the sample. However, the performance of the method is poor when sample sizes are small, age-reading error is correlated among readers, when both readers are biased, and for ages that are poorly represented in the sample. The method is applied for illustrative purposes to data on multiple-aged fish in Australia's southern and eastern scalefish and shark fishery.

  abstract = {Age information derived from calcified structures is commonly used to estimate recruitment, growth, and mortality for fish populations. Validation of daily or annual marks on age structures is often assumed, presumably due to a lack of general knowledge concerning the status of age validation studies. Therefore, the current status of freshwater fish age validation studies was summarized to show where additional effort is needed, and increase the accessibility of validation studies to researchers. In total, 1351 original peer-reviewed articles were reviewed from freshwater systems that studied age in fish. Periodicity and age validation studies were found for 88 freshwater species comprising 21 fish families. The number of age validation studies has increased over the last 30 years following previous calls for more research; however, few species have validated structures spanning all life stages. In addition, few fishes of conservation concern have validated ageing structures. A prioritization framework, using a combination of eight characteristics, is offered to direct future age validation studies and close the validation information gap. Additional study, using the offered prioritization framework, and increased availability of published studies that incorporate uncertainty when presenting research results dealing with age information are needed.},

  abstract = {Mortality, growth, and recruitment are the primary dynamic rate functions that regulate fish populations. Age data obtained from calcified structures can provide direct and indirect information needed for calculations of these metrics; therefore, knowledge of the fish population age structure is often coveted information. Unfortunately, potential sources of error exist in the form of subjectivity in interpretation of growth increments, inconsistent deposition of growth increments, and lack of validation in age-estimation processes. However, many sources of error are either not known or simply ignored, particularly for long-lived fishes. Therefore, we included a level of uncertainty in our age estimates of a periodic life history strategist, the Shovelnose Sturgeon Scaphirhynchus platorynchus, by incorporating variability in reader assignment of age. We used a bootstrapping procedure to generate a matrix of new age distributions and demonstrated how calculations of mortality varied as a result of reader assignment variability. Varying mortality rates of adult Shovelnose Sturgeon in a three-stage, female-only population projection model resulted in a wide range of potential responses. Hypothetical population projections after simulating for 30 years ranged from 2,249 to 10,673 individuals, despite mortality estimates varying by only 15\% (28\textendash{}43\%). Age-determination errors are an impediment to understanding fish population dynamics using conventional age-based assessments; therefore, consequences of aging error should be considered when attempting to model population dynamic processes and long-term viability.},

  abstract = {Management agencies often estimate the ages of Largemouth Bass Micropterus salmoides based on the examination of scales\textemdash{}a structure that is known to produce biased estimates\textemdash{}without knowing how the associated bias affects management decisions. We sought to understand the effects of this bias by comparing population metrics that were predicted using scale-derived and otolith-derived age data. We collected scales and otoliths from Largemouth Bass that were sampled during standard electrofishing surveys. The age of each fish was estimated independently by three separate readers using both scales and otoliths. We assessed the average coefficient of variation for scale-derived and otolithderived age estimates, examined the bias of scale-derived age estimates, and estimated von Bertalanffy growth model parameters by using ages estimated from scales and otoliths. These parameter estimates were used in yield-per-recruit simulations that predicted yield and the percentage of individuals in the cohort surviving to 380 mm (proportional size distribution [PSD] 380) or to 470 mm (PSD 470) at several levels of natural mortality and fishing mortality. Otolith-derived age estimates were more precise; scale-derived age estimates showed significant positive bias for fish younger than age 6 and significant negative bias for fish older than age 6. Von Bertalanffy parameter estimates were significantly different when using ages estimated from scales and those estimated from otoliths. Modeling indicated that estimates of yield and PSD 380 resulting from the two structures were similar. However, the use of scale-derived ages resulted in underestimating the impact of fishing mortality on PSD 470 by as much as five times at low levels of natural mortality and fishing mortality. Our estimates of precision and bias were similar to other comparisons of scales and otoliths, and the results of our yield-per-recruit simulations are likely generally applicable for Largemouth Bass management. Trophy fishing is a common management objective, and managers relying on scale-based age data could be less likely to adopt the restrictive harvest regulations that are critical for producing trophy Largemouth Bass.},

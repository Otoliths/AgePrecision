Similar procedures were used to compare otolith and spine ages from brown bullhead, Ameiurus nebulosus (Lesueur). Overall percent agreement between readers ranged from 91\% to 98\% for otoliths compared with 38\% to 67\% for scales and spines. Disagreement rates associated with scales and spines increased as fish grew older. Average percent error between readers was about an order of magnitude higher for scales and spines than for otoliths. Ages estimated from scales and spines progressively decreased as age increased based on otolith examination. The use of scales and spines to age largemouth bass, smallmouth bass, yellow perch and brown bullheads from the northeastern US was less precise and will likely lead to underestimation of age of larger and older fish.},

Age determined from digitised pictures was generally higher than that determined by using a stereomicroscope. This was particularly true for older specimens. For some individuals a change in the zoning pattern in the otoliths was observed. The occurrence of these changes was not closely correlated with the visually determined maturation index. For fish of similar size otolith radius was correlated with age. The growth rate also influenced otolith morphology.

We evaluated the precision and accuracy of a non-lethal ageing method for goliath grouper Epinephelus itajara, listed as critically endangered on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. Paired finray and otolith samples (n = 21) were collected opportunistically from fish that had died primarily from red tide or hypothermal events in Florida coastal waters. Finray ageing proved relatively precise (coefficient of variation [CV] = 4.24\%), although less so than otolith ageing (CV = 1.45\%). Finray ages agreed with otolith ages the majority of the time (CV = 3.15\% and concordance correlation coefficient = 0.991) for E. itajara from 0 to 18 yr of age. Based on a test of symmetry, finray ageing was also relatively unbiased for fish up to 18 yr of age. Further evaluation of any limitations of the method will depend on obtaining more samples, especially from larger, presumably older, fish. Clearly, the non-lethal finray ageing method can be used as an alternative to using otoliths for goliath grouper at least up to 18 yr of age. Finray ageing could significantly reduce the need to sacrifice protected E. itajara to assess their population recovery.},

Otoliths and dorsal spines were collected from 302 walleye considered known age in the Winnebago System, Wisconsin, USA: 142 that were assigned ages via progression of discrete length modes following an individual strong year class (ages 0\textendash{}3), and 160 (ages 4\textendash{}10, 12\textendash{}13, 16, 18) that were initially tagged at lengths small enough to accurately assign age $\pm$1 year ($<$380mm) and later recaptured and assigned an age (assigned age at tagging plus number of years at liberty). Paired aging structures were also collected from over 2000 additional walleye sampled during spawning assessments, tournament monitoring, and other surveys to better understand the relationship between spine and otolith age estimates and to compare catch curve residuals from structure and sex-specific catch curves to standard walleye recruitment indices. We found otoliths were accurate for walleye ages 0\textendash{}10, while dorsal spines yielded relatively accurate age estimates for walleye ages 1\textendash{}5, but underestimated age of walleye age-6 and older. Age distributions within catch curves constructed from otolith age estimates correlated well with measured year class strength, while age distributions from dorsal spine age estimates correlated poorly. Our results from fish considered known age validate the accuracy of otolith age estimates for walleye up to age-10, with corroborating evidence from catch curves and accurate recruitment indices strongly suggesting that otoliths are valid for all ages of Winnebago System walleye. We recommend the use of otoliths to accurately estimate walleye age, growth, and mortality, and to provide accurate age data for other population analyses.},

The process of age estimation, as undertaken by human operators, involves a complex mix of pattern recognition and interpretation based on knowledge and experience. It is best characterised as a skill rather than an art. Such an approach promotes the use of well-recognised techniques designed to maintain and enhance skills that also assist in maintaining standards. The results of a questionnaire completed by representatives of over 50 ageing laboratories worldwide were used to assess current quality assurance and quality control practices. Results indicate a great diversity in attention to, and no clear consensus on desirable standards for, quality issues, including staff training, use of reference sets, reading protocols, and post-reading analyses. This is considered more likely to reflect variation in awareness of the importance of quality issues than variation in the need for quality assurance and quality control measures. Greater attention to a range of quality control processes is urged, particularly the more regular use of reference sets.},

Out of the three pairs of otoliths, the lapillus and sagitta provided reliable age estimates for free embryos and larvae up to 17 days of (known) age post-fertilisation, with first micro-increment formation occurring five days postfertilisation. On the other hand, micro-increments on asterisci formed only 16\textendash{}17 days post-fertilisation. There was agreement in microincrement counts based on lapilli and sagittae, but not between interpreters, indicating that despite consistency between the two pairs of otoliths extensive training and experience are required for reliable age interpretation.

Age estimates showed high numbers of fish of ages 5, 6, and 11 in 2014, corresponding to the 2009, 2008, and 2003 year-classes, respectively. Strong 2003 and 2009 year-classes, along with the 2005 year-class, were also evident based on distinct modes of age-1 fish ($<$110 mm) in the length frequency distributions from 2004, 2010, and 2006, respectively. Modes from these year-classes were present as progressively larger fish in subsequent years. Few to no age-1 fish ($<$110 mm) were present in all other years. Ages estimated from otoliths were generally within 1 year of the ages corresponding to strong year-classes, at least for age-5 and older fish, suggesting that Kiyi age may be reliably estimated to within 1 year by careful examination of thin-sectioned otoliths.},

In the absence of age validation, important steps are to review the precision of age estimation methods and evaluate whether age estimates yield growth rates consistent with known fish growth based on tag recoveries. We assessed the precision of age estimates using pelvic fin rays and scales for migratory bull trout (297-605 mm total length) from the North Fork Clearwater River, and then compared growth estimates derived from both structures with growth based on tag recoveries. Fin rays produced a lower coefficient of variation (CV = 5.84) than scales (CV = 12.56). Ages estimated from scales were higher for fish aged $<$ 5 with fin rays and lower for fish aged $\geq$ 5. Comparisons of growth estimates derived from 70 tagged bull trout at large from 0.35 to 3.02 years with age-length equations based on fin ray and scale annuli indicated that ages estimated from fin rays (N = 189, predicted length of an age 3 fish = 310mm) were closely related to the apparent ages estimated from the mark-recapture model (apparent age of a 310mm fish = 2.9) whereas scales (N = 65, predicted length of an age 3 fish = 408mm) were not. This is the first study to assess the precision of structures for modeling growth of larger migratory bull trout. However validation of annuli formation from the recapture of known-age fish is recommended.},

Mean and systematic differences in age estimates were compared among structures using consensus ages from two readers; precision of age structures was quantified through the use of age\textendash{}bias plots, coefficient of variation, and percent agreement; reader confidence was indexed as a measure of overall reader uncertainty for each individual fish by structure. Mean age estimates based on otoliths were systematically higher (7.8 years) than based on scales (6.0 years) or fin rays (5.6 years). Ages determined using otoliths generated a wider range of ages and greater number of age classes (1\textendash{}23 years, 20 age classes) when compared with scales (1\textendash{}16 years, 15 age classes) and fin rays (1\textendash{}14 years, 13 age classes). Otoliths were the most precise of the structures (CV = 4.7, compared with 7.4 for scales and 12.1 for fin rays). Percent agreement between readers indicated high precision and reproducibility of age estimates using otoliths. Percent reader uncertainty was lowest when using otoliths (7.6\%) in comparison with fin rays (21.2\%) or scales (26.8\%). This study is the first evaluation of precision and bias of age structures for Lake Champlain's unexploited lake whitefish population and suggests that otoliths are the most appropriate structure for age estimation. However, the differences in age estimates from the three structures in this study emphasize the importance of validating aging structures to provide accurate age estimates for Lake Champlain.},

Age data are essential for describing population dynamic rate functions, but few studies have addressed the selection of ideal calcified structures for estimating age in gars. We collected Spotted Gars Lepisosteus oculatus, Shortnose Gars L. platostomus, and Longnose Gars L. osseus from 12 Illinois water bodies to assess the relative bias and precision of age estimates derived from branchiostegal rays, pectoral fin rays, cleithra, and sagittal otoliths. Age assignments differed among these calcified structures for all three species. Branchiostegal rays underestimated the age of young fish and overestimated the age of old fish relative to all other structures. Pectoral fin rays consistently underestimated age relative to other structures and produced the lowest mean and maximum age estimates. Although there was low relative bias between readers for all structures, age assignments showed greater variability between readers for old age-classes when age estimates were derived from cleithra and otoliths. Between-reader precision was highest using pectoral fin rays, whereas cleithra and otoliths generated lower coefficients of variation and percent agreement values. These findings reveal a need to improve or modify structure processing methods to increase readability when cleithra and otoliths are used for age estimation. Given these results, future validation studies should target branchiostegal rays and pectoral fin rays to determine the most accurate calcified structure for aging gars.},

We evaluated the precision and efficiency of scale acetate impressions, transverse pectoral fin ray sections, and transverse sagittal otolith sections for three lake whitefish stocks (Bailey's Harbor, Naubinway, and Saugatuck) that were sampled in Lake Michigan during 2004 and 2005. We conducted a decision matrix analysis that incorporated capital, production, and personnel costs and precision of age estimates to determine the best aging method given current management priorities. For the Bailey's Harbor stock, age estimates were systematically lower based on scales (mean \textonequarter{} 7.85 years) than based on fin rays (8.44 years) or otoliths (8.78 years); fin ray and otolith estimates did not differ significantly. Similar results were observed for both Naubinway and Saugatuck stocks. For Bailey's Harbor lake whitefish, greater precision in age estimates was achieved by use of fin rays (median coefficient of variation [CV] \textonequarter{} 4.88\%) than by use of scales (5.44\%) or otoliths (5.44\%). For the Saugatuck stock, age estimates were more precise when obtained from pectoral fin rays (median CV \textonequarter{} 4.96\%) than from scales, but precision did not differ between fin ray and sagittal otolith ages. Differences between scale and pectoral fin ray age estimates began at age 5 for the Bailey's Harbor stock and at age 6 for the Naubinway and Saugatuck stocks. Differences between scale and sagittal otolith age estimates began at age 5 for the Bailey's Harbor and Saugatuck stocks and at age 8 for the Naubinway stock. Based on the decision matrix analysis, pectoral fin rays provided more-precise estimates and their use involved lower costs than use of the other methods; therefore, pectoral fin rays were deemed the best method for aging lake whitefish in Lake Michigan under current conditions.},

In the first test, the readers determined the age of each individual from one calcified structure (scale, otolith, or opercular bone) at a time. The samples from three populations, 50 specimens in each, were mixed so that the readers did not know which population each calcified structure was from. A sample of known-age whitefish was used in the second age determination test, where information such as time of catch, length, weight, and sex was available to the readers. In each of the 50 envelopes the reader got scale impressions and two otoliths, one of which had been burned and ground. In the first test, the precision of the readers was low both between readers and between different structures. In the samples of slow-growing populations, the determinations made from the otoliths showed older ages than the determinations from the scales. In the second age determination test the results were better; 73-90\% (average 82\%) of the determinations were correct. The use of two calcified structures and the knowledge of the material were considered to improve the accuracy. Age determination bias may occur that affects the age distribution: even though 80\% of the fish were aged correctly, an exceptionally strong or weak year class could remain unidentified. The estimation of growth rate seemed less sensitive to incorrect age determination than age distribution.},

White Perch were first observed in Sooner Reservoir, a thermally altered cooling reservoir in Oklahoma, by the Oklahoma Department of Wildlife Conservation in 2006. It is unknown how thermally altered systems like Sooner Reservoir may affect the precision of White Perch age estimates. Previous studies have found that age structures from Largemouth Bass Micropterus salmoides and Bluegills Lepomis macrochirus from thermally altered reservoirs had false annuli, which increased error when estimating ages. Our objective was to quantify the precision of White Perch age estimates using four sagittal otolith preparation techniques (whole, broken, browned, and stained). Because Sooner Reservoir is thermally altered, we also wanted to identify the best month to collect a White Perch age sample based on aging precision. Ages of 569 White Perch (20\textendash{}308 mm TL) were estimated using the four techniques. Age estimates from broken, stained, and browned otoliths ranged from 0 to 8 years; whole-view otolith age estimates ranged from 0 to 7 years. The lowest mean coefficient of variation (CV) was obtained using broken otoliths, whereas the highest CV was observed using browned otoliths. July was the most precise month (lowest mean CV) for estimating age of White Perch, whereas April was the least precise month (highest mean CV). These results underscore the importance of knowing the best method to prepare otoliths for achieving the most precise age estimates and the best time of year to obtain those samples, as these factors may affect other estimates of population dynamics.},

Ageing precision and agreement of assigned ages were compared among scales, fin rays and otoliths from bull trout 52\textendash{}711 mm TL. Annulus formation was validated for 88\% (14 of 16 fish) of recaptured bull trout using pelvic fin rays and 68\% using scales (15 of 22 fish). Annulus formation in fin rays occurred between late April to early June, and the hyaline (non-growth) band began forming in late August. Back-calculated length was not significantly different from measured length at initial capture either for fin rays or scales (P \textdaggerdbl{} 0.19), and absolute percent error was 7.2 $\pm$ 1.2 (mean $\pm$ SE; n = 14) for fin rays and 8.7 $\pm$ 1.9 (n = 15) for scales.

However, fin rays (87\% precision) and otoliths (90\%) provided notably higher ageing precision than scales (68\%) and closer agreement of assigned ages, particularly for fish older than age 4.

Based on the highest percentage of agreement (PA) and the lowest average percentage of error as well as on the values of coefficient of variation between readers, otoliths provided a precise age estimate of S. curvifrons and S. niger individuals, while vertebrae showed a precise age estimate of those of S. esocinus.

  abstract = {Scales are commonly used to age largemouth bass since the samples are easy to extract and process. Yet, scale annuli are often difficult to interpret among the largest (and presumably oldest) individuals. The goal of this study was to determine whether a more precise nonlethal structure could be used to age largemouth bass. We examined scales, pectoral fin rays, and dorsal fin spines from largemouth bass collected from six glacial lakes in northern Indiana. Collectively, 861 structures were aged by three analysts and post-concert reads concluded with 85\%, 94\%, and 99\% agreement for scales, pectoral fin rays, and dorsal fin spines, respectively. Pre-concert exact ($\pm$ 0 years) percent agreement among age analysts was highest for dorsal fin spines (27\%) followed by pectoral fin rays (23\%) and scales (2\%). Mean coefficient of variation was lowest among dorsal fin spines (16\%) followed by pectoral fin rays (22\%) and scales (37\%). Scales exhibited the most variability and bias, while dorsal fin spines were the least variable and most unbiased structure. We encourage researchers to use scales for younger fish and dorsal fin spines for larger fish when both: (1) nonlethal methods and (2) a higher standard of precision are sought to evaluate specific management objectives.},

  abstract = {Sagittal otoliths are the preferred aging structure for Micropterus spp. (black basses) in North America because of the accurate and precise results produced. Typically, fisheries managers are hesitant to use lethal aging techniques (e.g., otoliths) to age rare species, trophy-size fish, or when sampling in small impoundments where populations are small. Therefore, we sought to evaluate the precision and accuracy of 2 non-lethal aging structures (i.e., anal fin spines, dorsal fin spines) in comparison to that of sagittal otoliths from known-age Micropterus salmoides (Largemouth Bass; n = 87) collected from the Ocmulgee Public Fishing Area, GA. Sagittal otoliths exhibited the highest concordance with true ages of all structures evaluated (coefficient of variation = 1.2; percent agreement = 91.9). Similarly, the low coefficient of variation (0.0) and high between-reader agreement (100\%) indicate that age estimates obtained from sagittal otoliths were the most precise. Relatively high agreement between readers for anal fin spines (84\%) and dorsal fin spines (81\%) suggested the structures were relatively precise. However, age estimates from anal fin spines and dorsal fin spines exhibited low concordance with true ages. Although use of sagittal otoliths is a lethal technique, this method will likely remain the standard for aging Largemouth Bass and other similar black bass species.},

Scales and dorsal spines can also be analyzed to measure age, but precision and accuracy problems have been documented. Use of opercles to estimate age in Largmouth and Smallmouth Bass has not been previously examined. Utilization of both otoliths and opercles requires sacrificing the fish, but opercles are easier to remove and process than otoliths. In our study, four readers estimated the ages of the fish using each of the four structures. Opercles had the lowest coefficient of variation (CV) for both species (Largemouth Bass = 6.31, Smallmouth Bass = 5.23), but underestimated the ages of Largemouth Bass older than nine and Smallmouth Bass older than six, relative to otoliths. Opercles proved easier to prepare and read, and the results showed lower age-bias, higher precision, higher among-reader agreement, and less reader bias than scales and dorsal spines.},

Our objectives were to determine if: 1) sagittal otoliths provided more precise age estimates than cleithra for northern pike from two populations, and 2) sagittal otolith age estimates differed systematically from cleithrum age estimates for two populations of northern pike. Ages were estimated by three independent individuals with different experience levels from sagittal otoliths and cleithra collected from 66 northern pike (32\textendash{}101 cm total length) from Devils Lake, North Dakota and 45 northern pike (27\textendash{}52 cm total length) from Cable Lake, Wisconsin. Cleithrum age estimates were more precise than those from sagittal otoliths for northern pike from Devils Lake, and were similar to sagittal otolith age estimates for northern pike from Cable Lake. Sagittal otolith age estimates were similar to cleithrum age estimates for northern pike from Devils Lake, but were dissimilar for northern pike from Cable Lake. We recommend using cleithra for estimating age of northern pike given that no specialized equipment is required for processing and age estimation. However, other studies are needed to further investigate the use of sagittal otoliths to estimate age of northern pike.},

  abstract = {Saugeye are hatchery produced hybrids (female walleye [Sander vitreus] and male sauger [S. canadensis]) that have been introduced to aquatic systems throughout the United States. The Oklahoma Department of Wildlife Conservation (ODWC) stocks reservoirs throughout Oklahoma with saugeye to control overcrowded, stunted white crappie (Pomoxis annularis) populations and to provide recreational fishing opportunities. Because sacrificing fish regularly to remove otoliths for age estimation is often unpopular with anglers, a non-lethal means of obtaining age estimates for saugeye to describe population dynamics is desirable. Therefore, we compared age estimate precision between readers and structures (otoliths and dorsal spines), and compared age-based population parameters (growth, mortality, recruitment) derived from these age estimates. Structures were removed from 47 saugeye collected from Thunderbird Reservoir, Oklahoma via electrofishing. Separate age-length keys were developed using consensus ages estimated from each structure, and ages were applied to an additional 253 unaged saugeye (300 fish total) for comparison of age-based population parameters for each structure. Precision was highest between readers for broken otoliths (100\% agreement; CV\,=\,0\%) and whole otoliths (98\% agreement; CV\,=\,3.2\%), whereas precision was poor for dorsal spine ages (55\% agreement; CV\,=\,22.3\%). When comparing final consensus ages, broken otoliths and whole otoliths were in 100\% agreement; however, otolith and spine agreement was 14\%. Age bias plots indicate that final consensus spine ages always were higher than the final consensus ages from otoliths. Because age assignments from the two structures were dissimilar, corresponding mortality rates, growth models, and recruitment patterns were vastly different. We concluded that dorsal spines are not an appropriate aging structure for saugeye in Oklahoma, as age estimates lacked precision and produced erroneous population parameters. Fisheries managers should continue to sacrifice saugeye to obtain otoliths for aging for the most reliable data.},

  abstract = {The ages of 229 white suckers Catostomus commersonii from six drainages in the upper Missouri River basin were estimated from scales, pectoral fin ray sections, and lapilli otolith sections to evaluate the potential bias of age estimates between structures. Age estimates were compared by calculating the coefficient of variation, average percent error, percent agreement, and percent agreement within 1 year, as well as by constructing age bias plots. Overall, the relative precision of age estimates from pectoral fin rays and otoliths was higher than that of age estimates from scales and otoliths, but neither pair differed in precision from scales and fin rays. The relative precision of age estimates between pairs of structures was variable both within and among drainages, and few trends could be detected. The percent agreement between structures ranged from 50.0\% to 93.8\% among drainages, but 9 of 18 pairs had agreement rates greater than 70.0\%. Percent agreement within 1 year was greater than 85.0\% for all pairs of structures in all drainages. Age estimates from scales underestimated the age estimates from pectoral fin rays and otoliths beyond age 3, while pectoral fin rays only slightly underestimated ages from otoliths of fish older than age 6. We recommend sectioned lapilli otoliths for estimating the age of white suckers, especially if mature individuals are present in the population and lethal collection techniques are allowed. Pectoral fin ray sections are the best nonlethal structure for estimating the age of white suckers but may underestimate the ages of fish older than 5 years. Scales remain suitable for estimating the ages of immature fish, but their use is not recommended for mature fish. This information will allow fisheries managers and researchers to select the most appropriate structure for use in future age assessment studies of white suckers and other catostomid species.},

Using otoliths of the two major commercial species, golden redfish (Sebastes marinus) and deep-sea redfish (S. mentella), a series of exchange schemes was carried out to assess bias and precision of age readings between four readers and between two preparation methods. Considerable bias between readers and moderate precision were observed for the S. marinus readings, especially for ages O20 years, with coefficients of variation (CV) of 7.7e12.0\% and average percent error (APE) of 5.4e8.5\%. Agreement between readers increased from 17e28\% to 45e61\% when allowing deviations of G1 year, and to 80e92\% with G3 years tolerance. The age of S. marinus determined from broken and burnt otoliths was estimated to be slightly lower than when the age of the same individuals was determined from thin-sectioned otoliths. The bias and precision estimates obtained from the S. mentella material were generally poorer than for S. marinus (CV 8.2e19.1\%, APE 5.8e13.5\%), but similar to reported values for other long-lived fish species. Better than 50\% agreement was only achieved with G3 years tolerance. Growth rates differed significantly between species, confirming slower growth for S. mentella. For S. marinus, only one reader comparison revealed significantly different growth functions, whereas almost all S. mentella reader pairs showed significant differences in growth curves. Section and break-and-burn readings of S. marinus did not differ significantly. Average ages of around 9e10 years were determined for juvenile S. mentella 24e30 cm long, which were likely to have migrated from East Greenland into the Irminger Sea, based on earlier observations. As some of the error in the age determinations presented could be attributed to interpretation differences between readers, further intercalibration of redfish ageing is urgently needed in order to provide consistent input data for stock assessment. \'O 2005 International Council for the Exploration of the Sea.

Ages determined using scales agreed with those determined using otoliths in 70.8\% of fish and agreement declined with age. Scale derived age estimates were on average younger than otolith derived estimates. The maximum age of the fish collected from Ham's Fork and Yellow Creek was three years.

In this investigation, we examined precision of age estimates derived from scales, pectoral fin rays, and sagittal otoliths from 167 mountain whitefish. Otoliths and pectoral fin rays were mounted in epoxy and cross-sectioned before examination. Scales were pressed onto acetate slides and resulting impressions were examined. Between-reader precision (i.e., between 2 readers), between-reader variability, and reader confidence ratings were compared among hard structures. Coefficient of variation (CV) in age estimates was lowest and percentage of exact agreement (PA-0) was highest for scales (CV = 5.9; PA-0 = 70\%) compared to pectoral fin rays (CV = 11.0; PA-0 = 58\%) and otoliths (CV = 12.3; PA-0 = 55\%). Median confidence ratings were significantly different (P $\leq$ 0.05) among all structures, with scales having the highest median confidence. Reader confidence decreased with fish age for scales and pectoral fin rays, but reader confidence increased with fish age for otoliths. In general, age estimates were more precise and reader confidence was higher for scales compared to pectoral fin rays and otoliths. This research will help fisheries biologists in selecting the most appropriate hard structure to use for future age and growth studies on mountain whitefish. In turn, selection of the most precise hard structure will lead to better estimates of dynamic rate functions.},

Age estimation accuracy for black crappie otoliths averaged 99.6\%, whereas accuracy for scales was 77.6\%. Accuracy of age estimates from white crappie otoliths averaged 98.5\%, whereas accuracy of estimates from scales averaged 80.4\%. For both species, age estimation precision was higher for otoliths than for scales. Reader bias (e.g., difference between true age and estimated age) tended to be greater for scales than otoliths in both species. Bias in otolith age estimation was minimal and only apparent for age-5 crappies, which were consistently underaged. Bias in scale age estimation was most apparent for age-4 and age-5 crappies, which were also typically underaged. Reader experience influenced the degree of precision and bias; experienced readers produced more precise and less biased age estimates. The use of otoliths to improve crappie age estimate precision and bias has been well documented. Through the use of known-age fish, we provide evidence that age estimate accuracy can also be improved.},

We evaluated the use of dorsal spines and scales as nonlethal alternatives to otoliths for estimating the ages of black crappies P. nigromaculatus using 111 fish collected from two Minnesota lakes. Among-reader precision was similar for ages estimated from scales and dorsal spines (coefficients of variation [CVs] \textonequarter{} 10\textendash{}14\%), but the precision associated with both structures was substantially lower than that observed for otoliths (CVs \textonequarter{} 0.12\textendash{}1.3\%). Complete reader agreement (i.e., all three readers agreed on age) for dorsal spines (44\textendash{}51\%) and scales (33\textendash{}36\%) was substantially lower than that observed for otoliths (87\textendash{}98\%). Partial agreement (i.e., at least two of three readers agreed on age) was 100\% for both otoliths and dorsal spines and between 79\% and 89\% for scales. Scale ages assigned by individual readers agreed with consensus otolith ages less than 70\% of the time; agreement of individual spine ages with consensus otolith ages was 33\% or less. Mean scale ages were usually similar to consensus otolith ages for crappies between the ages of 2 and 6 years, while mean spine ages were consistently lower than consensus otolith ages. Thin-sectioning dorsal spines did not significantly change the number of annuli detected by individual readers. Our results suggest that dorsal spines are not a useful alternative to scales for estimating black crappie age in a nonlethal manner. A conspicuous lumen located in the center of each dorsal spine partially or fully obscures at least one annulus. When otolith removal is not desirable, use of scales and multiple readers may provide mean age estimates that are similar to consensus otolith ages, but we suggest that otolith analysis remains the most reliable method for estimating black crappie age, regardless of latitude.},

  abstract = {Otoliths (asteriscus) have been validated as an accurate structure for estimating age of common carp Cyprinus carpio. However, extraction and processing of common carp otoliths are time consuming and require sacrifice of fish. Therefore, we analyzed age estimation precision of four alternative structures relative to otolith age for 139 common carp collected from five eastern South Dakota lakes. All common carp were collected using daytime electrofishing. Each fish was assigned an identification number and measured to the nearest millimeter total length, after which aging structures were removed. Age was estimated from scales, vertebrae, opercles, pectoral fin rays, and asteriscus otoliths by methods similar to those recommended by previous researchers. Relative to otolith age, average percent error was 6.8\% for scales, 15.4\% for vertebrae, 9.9\% for opercles, and 1.2\% for pectoral fin rays. Compared with all other structures, ages from pectoral fin ray sections were nearly as precise as otoliths through age 13 (lowest average percent error); however, fin rays consistently underestimated the ages of fish older than 13 years. In most cases, pectoral fin ray ages matched otolith ages, thereby providing similar age estimates. We conclude that pectoral fin rays provide a precise, economical, and nonlethal alternative for estimating common carp age structure. Accuracy of common carp ages estimated from pectoral fin rays still requires evaluation.},

To examine the accuracy and precision of age estimates, 16 pectoral fin ray samples from age-6 pallid sturgeon were obtained from Gavins Point National Fish Hatchery, South Dakota. The fin rays were sectioned, mounted, and independently examined twice by each of two readers. Only 28.1\% of the age estimates accurately reflected the known age of the fish. Multiple readings of the same sample by the same reader (within-reader precision) only agreed 25\% of the time, differences being as great as 5 years between the two estimates. Between-reader agreement was 46.9\%, the two readers' estimates of the same fish differing by as much as 2 years.

Removal and processing times were calculated by 10 fish groups. Dorsal spines required the least amount of time for removal, followed by scales and otoliths. Whole-view otoliths required no further manipulation prior to estimating age, while the sectioning of dorsal spines and scale pressing required 12.5 and 16.6 min of additional processing time, respectively. Dorsal spines and scales also required significantly more time to read than otoliths. In terms of total processing time, whole-view otoliths proved the most time-efficient approach for estimating the age of walleyes. Scales were slightly more time-efficient than dorsal-spine sections, and sectioning otoliths would add additional processing time. Sectioning may not have been necessary in this evaluation because ages estimated by an experienced viewer from the sectioned otoliths agreed with ages estimated from whole-view otoliths 98\% of the time (although reader inexperience could result in lower rates of agreement). The relative precision between readers was approximately five times greater with whole-view otoliths than with scales or spines. Reader agreement rates associated with whole-view otoliths were also significantly higher than rates for scales or spines. Based on our findings, otoliths provide the most time-efficient and precise approach for estimating the age of walleyes.},

For three independent readers, the precision (CV) of age estimates did not significantly differ among otoliths, cleithra, and anal fin rays but was significantly lower for scales than for the other structures. Similarly, partial agreement among readers was greater than 90\% for ages estimated from otoliths, cleithra, and anal fin rays, whereas partial agreement was 76\% for scale-based ages. We discuss the tradeoffs associated with precision and bias for each structure in the context of reader experience, fish age, and management goals. We recommend that when fish mortality is not a concern, otoliths or cleithra should be used to achieve high-precision aging of Northern Pike. For strictly nonlethal sampling scenarios, the anal fin rays of Northern Pike will yield more precise age estimates than scales.},

To our knowledge, no research has identified which calcified structure provides the most precise age estimates for mountain sucker, and little is known about mountain sucker population dynamics. To identify which structure provided the most precise age estimates, we compared age estimates from scales, sectioned pectoral fin rays, whole asteriscus otoliths, and polished asteriscus otoliths collected from 110 mountain sucker from 2 creeks in the Black Hills of South Dakota. Additionally, we quantified growth, age, and size at maturation for one population of mountain sucker in the Black Hills. Polished otoliths had the greatest precision of the 4 structures used, followed by sectioned pectoral fin rays. Mountain sucker reached an average size of 100 mm total length (TL) during their fourth growing season and reached an average maximum attainable size of 219 mm TL. Mountain sucker began to mature at age 3, with nearly all being mature by age 5. In the Black Hills, the shortest mature male was 95 mm TL and the shortest mature female was 101 mm TL. We recommend using polished otoliths to estimate the ages of mountain sucker. If a nonlethal structure is desired to estimate the ages of mountain sucker, we recommend using sectioned pectoral fin rays. Future research should be directed to fill the many knowledge gaps in the biology and ecology of mountain sucker (e.g., juvenile habitat use in the Black Hills). As these knowledge gaps are addressed, management actions could be taken to conserve this species in the parts of its range where it is declining.},

  abstract = {Dorsal spines may be a suitable structure for aging walleyes Sander vitreus when the otoliths are unavailable due to live release of the catch, but the specialized equipment and additional time necessary to remove and mount a readable cross section can discourage their use. I evaluated a simple method of obtaining age estimates from unsectioned dorsal spines. The basal end of each dorsal spine was sanded smooth and viewed under a dissecting microscope with side illumination. For Red Lake, Minnesota, walleyes, where consensus otolith ages by two experienced readers indicated that most fish were younger than age 7, reader agreement rates (95\%) and precision (mean coefficient of variation (CV) = 0.95\%) of dorsal spine estimates were relatively high. Age estimates by individual readers inspecting spines generally agreed with consensus otolith ages ($\geq$95\%). Reader agreement rates (70\%) and precision (mean CV = 2.71\%) were much lower for a sample of walleyes collected from Mille Lacs Lake, Minnesota, where 94\% of consensus otolith ages were greater than age 6. Furthermore, spine-based age estimates for Mille Lacs Lake walleyes exhibited relatively poor agreement with consensus otolith ages ($\leq$40\%); however, most of the discrepancies were noted for individuals of consensus otolith age 7 or more, and consistent underestimation of ages did not occur until age 13. Based on these findings, unsectioned dorsal spines offered a reasonably precise, nonlethal, and simple approach for replicating consensus otolith ages for walleyes younger than age 7. Although otoliths may still be necessary to estimate the ages of older individuals within a sample, use of unsectioned dorsal spines could allow biologists to sacrifice fewer walleyes while closely replicating otolith-based estimates of population age structure.},

We also validated a new method using pectoral spines in which a single cut is made through the dorsal and anterior processes (hereafter termed cut spines) and annuli are enhanced with side illumination. Age estimates from otoliths and cut spines were compared with age estimates from traditional articulating process sections of pectoral spines for channel catfish of known ages (1\textendash{}4).

Otoliths were more accurate and less variable in estimating age. Otolith age estimates were always within 1 year and, after mutual examination of the structures in question, 97\% of the assigned ages agreed with known age. The accuracy of cut spines and articulating process sections after mutual examination was similar; however, the cut-spine method was simpler than preparing articulating process sections.

Three readers of varying experience estimated ages. The precision (mean coefficient of variation) of estimates among readers was 1\% for sagittal otoliths, 5\textendash{}6\% for anal spines, and 11\textendash{}13\% for scales. Agreement rates among readers were 94\textendash{}95\% for otoliths, 71\textendash{}76\% for anal spines, and 45\textendash{}50\% for scales. Systematic age estimation differences were evident among scale and anal spine readers; less-experienced readers tended to underestimate ages of yellow perch older than age 4 relative to estimates made by an experienced reader. Mean scale age tended to underestimate ages of age-6 and older fish relative to otolith ages estimated by an experienced reader. Total annual mortality estimates based on scale ages were 20\% higher than those based on otolith ages; mortality estimates based on anal spine ages were 4\% higher than those based on otolith ages. Otoliths required more removal and preparation time than scales and anal spines, but age estimation time was substantially lower for otoliths than for the other two structures. We suggest the use of otoliths or anal spines for age estimation in yellow perch (regardless of length) from Lake Erie and other systems where precise age estimates are necessary, because age estimation errors resulting from the use of scales could generate incorrect management decisions.},

  abstract = {Age based assessment forms the basis of management advice for the heavily exploited combined stock of blue whiting (Micromesistius poutassou) in the Northeast Atlantic. However, little historic attention has been given to the reliability of age estimates gathered from several nations involved in this assessment. Using recognised graphical and statistical approaches, bias and precision was investigated for experienced age-readers of blue whiting. Significant linear bias was found to exist between age-readers, with ages differing, on average, by 1 year for important year classes. Indications are that spawning checks and split rings affect the interpretation of annuli for some age-readers. An experience gradient became evident during the analysis; more experienced age-readers had greater levels of precision. Within reader precision was found to be higher than between reader precision; however, within reader bias was also evident with two out of three age-readers systematically revising ages downwards when re-ageing otoliths. Results indicate that differences exist on a limited international level for the age determination of blue whiting. This issue now needs to be addressed by the scientific community.},

The majority of fish were subspecies A. p. probatocephalus (84\%), 11\% were A. p. oviceps, and 5\% could not be designated. Fish were aged using sectioned sagittal otoliths. Maximum ages were 12 and 14 yrs for females and males, respectively. Marginal-increment analysis and chemical marking validated the formation of only one annulus per year. Annulus deposition occurred during March and April, and was complete by May. Patterns of growth in both length-atage and weight-at-age were not different either between the sexes or between subspecies. Sheepshead were smaller at any given age compared to fish from South Carolina, but were generally larger than sheepshead used in coast-wide estimates for Florida. Fish from Louisiana were of similar overall size compared to sheepshead from both the northwest coast of Florida and coast-wide Florida. The use of regionally-explicit models of growth may be appropriate for sheepshead because of growth differences among populations in the southeastern United States. These differences in growth may result from several factors, including differences in mortality rates, environmental conditions, or genetic variation.},

  abstract = {The roundel skate (Raja texana) inhabits near-shore waters throughout the Gulf of Mexico. Despite such a wide distribution, very little is known about its biology. In order to gain insight into the life history of this species, the age, growth and maturity of 231 skates ranging in size from 277 to 630-mm total length (TL) were examined. Based on vertebral band counts, the oldest age estimates obtained were 8 years for males and 9 for females, which corresponded to 495-mm TL and 630-mm TL respectively. Age-bias plots and coefficient of variation suggested that our ageing method represents a non-biased and precise approach to age assessment. Marginal increment and edge analyses suggested that growth bands are formed annually with a distinct trend of increasing growth at the beginning of March. Back calculations suggested a birth size of 113\textendash{}118-mm TL. Observed and back-calculated length-at-age data were used to assess growth with four different models, including the von Bertalanffy (VBGM), von Bertalanffy with size at birth (VB with L0), Gompertz and Francis models. Male and female growth was significantly different. The VBGM and the Francis model produced similar results and provided the best fit. Curves fitted with observed and back-calculated data suggested slightly faster growth than curves fitted with only observed data. Maturity occurred at 444-mm TL and 4.95 years for males, whereas females matured at 537-mm TL and 5.8 years.},

  abstract = {We evaluated annulus formation and readers' ability to recognize known annuli from otoliths, pectoral fin rays, and scales of alligator gar Atractosteus spatula using known-age (0 and 1 years) and chemically marked fish. Chemical marks were generally associated with annuli, and confirmed annulus formation occurred around May. In all bony structures, annuli appeared as narrow translucent lines that immediately preceded wider opaque bands; however, annuli in pectoral fin rays and scales were more variable in appearance than otoliths. In otoliths, the number of observed annuli corresponded with the number of years fish were at large for 96\% of the fish. In contrast, periodicity of annuli in pectoral fin rays and scales only corresponded with the number of years fish were at large in 19\% and 12\% of the fish, respectively. Precision of age estimates was initially poor for all structures; percent agreement between two independent readers was only 49\% for otoliths, 43\% for pectoral fin rays, and 37\% for scales. Agreement increased to 83\% for otoliths, 65\% for pectoral fin rays, and 60\% for scales following a second independent age assessment. Final average coefficients of variation between readers were 2, 5, and 11\% for otoliths, pectoral fin rays, and scales, respectively. Increased precision was the result of experience and an improved ability to identify annuli because of chemical reference marks. Although correct identification of annuli required substantial training, our study validates annulus formation in otoliths of alligator gar. In contrast, annulus formation was not validated for pectoral fin rays or scales from alligator gar older than age 6, but age estimates from pectoral fin rays of young alligator gar may have some utility.

  abstract = {The ages of brook trout Salvelinus fontinalis are typically estimated using scales despite a lack of research documenting the effectiveness of this technique. The use of scales is often preferred because it is nonlethal and is believed to require less effort than alternative methods. To evaluate the relative effectiveness of different age estimation methodologies for brook trout, we measured the precision and processing times of scale, sagittal otolith, and pectoral fin ray age estimation techniques. Three independent readers, age bias plots, coefficients of variation (CV \textonequarter{} 100 3 SD/mean), and percent agreement (PA) were used to measure within-reader, among-structure bias and within-structure, among-reader precision. Bias was generally minimal; however, the age estimates derived from scales tended to be lower than those derived from otoliths within older (age . 2) cohorts. Otolith, fin ray, and scale age estimates were within 1 year of each other for 95\% of the comparisons. The measures of precision for scales (CV \textonequarter{} 6.59; PA \textonequarter{} 82.30) and otoliths (CV \textonequarter{} 7.45; PA \textonequarter{} 81.48) suggest higher agreement between these structures than with fin rays (CV \textonequarter{} 11.30; PA \textonequarter{} 65.84). The mean per-sample processing times were lower for scale (13.88 min) and otolith techniques (12.23 min) than for fin ray techniques (22.68 min). The comparable processing times of scales and otoliths contradict popular belief and are probably a result of the high proportion of regenerated scales within samples and the ability to infer age from whole (as opposed to sectioned) otoliths. This research suggests that while scales produce age estimates rivaling those of otoliths for younger (age , 3) cohorts, they may be biased within older cohorts and therefore should be used with caution.},

  abstract = {Transverse thin sections (0.5 mm thick) of sagittal otoliths from 290 Murray cod up to 1400 mm in total length and 47.3 kg in weight were used to establish the age and growth of cod in the lower Murray-Darling Basin, including comparisons of recent (1986-91) and past (1949-51) growth rates and growth in different waters. The maximum estimated age was 48 years. Quantitative and qualitative analysis of the seasonal changes in otolith marginal increments showed that annuli in fish of all ages were laid down each spring, and 1 October was assigned as the birthday. The thin-sectioning method was validated by comparing age estimates for 55 Murray cod from Lake Charlegrark (age 0-21 years), which had been validated by using burnt and polished half-otoliths. The new method had an accuracy of 96.4\% and it offers major advantages in ease of preparation, reading, and batch-handling of large numbers of otoliths. The precision of the method, estimated as an average error for four readers, was 5.4\% (3.0\% after ignoring discrepancies in relation to annuli on otolith edges). There was a linear relationship between otolith weight and fish age and an exponential relationship between otolith weight and fish length. Both otolith length and otolith width reached an asymptote at about 15 years, when fish length also approached its maximum. However, otolith thickness continued to increase throughout the life of the fish and, after about 15 years, contributed most to the increase in otolith weight. This confirmed that otoliths continued to grow in thickness and that annuli were laid down throughout life, and that cod could be aged reliably to the maximum age. The annulus pattern is very clear and distinct, and the reading techniques are fully described, including recognition of 'larval' and 'false' rings. Various differences were found in the growth rates, and the length-weight relationships for males and females, for cod caught in 1986-91 and those caught in 1949-51, and various subpopulations are discussed. The von Bertalanffy growth parameters (all individuals combined) were estimated at L , = 1202 mm, k = O 108 and to= -0.832. The availability of a reliable ageing method provides the first opportunity to determine year of birth and thus to examine the age structure of populations and to effectively manage cod populations that have declined in abundance.},

The aims of this study were to investigate the accuracy and precision of age estimates from transverse sections of sagittal otoliths and to assess effects on these of the geographic area of collection and otolith preparation method. Two independent validation studies suggested an approximately annual formation of annuli in otoliths, predominantly for otoliths with 4\textendash{}10 annuli but also for one otolith with 29 annuli. Otolith sections produced exceptionally high annulus counts: up to 56 annuli for samples from the Great Barrier Reef (GBR), Australia; and up to 55 annuli from the Seychelles, indicating a high longevity for this species. The precision of otolith readings from the GBR (index of average percent error, IAPE=3.21$\pm$0.26 S.E.) was within commonly accepted bounds for age estimation (IAPE up to 5\%) but precision of readings from the Seychelles was significantly lower (IAPE=9.18$\pm$0.47 S.E.) and outside of this ``acceptable'' range. Age-based biological parameters for red bass from the Seychelles should thus be applied with greater caution than those for red bass from the GBR. If basic demographic properties are assumed relatively constant across the wide geographic range sampled, however, results from the GBR could be used as more reliable preliminary data for precautionary management strategies in the Seychelles and elsewhere.},

Otoliths were collected from 119 stocked barramundi and were compared against the known age of the fish (range: 0.75\textendash{}8.64 years). The otoliths of barramundi appear to grow in three distinct phases when compared to the total length of the fish (TL), with a final change in otolith growth coinciding at the approximate size of sex change for this species (900mm TL). Otolith growth is correlated linearly in all directions throughout to total growth of the otolith.

The use of any of the three otolith dimensions (length, breadth, width), otolith weight or fish total length (TL) provided a similar population age structure to that of sectioned otoliths ages (P$>$0.05). Because of significant time savings and costs associated with the techniques, use of otolith weight or even fish TL relationships with fish age offer a real alternative to reading sectioned otoliths, as long as enough samples are used to account for any bias from sampling error. Use of otolith weight alone could reduce laboratory costs by 96\% when compared to sectioned otoliths, and has real utility for use in long-term monitoring.},

The legibility and interpretability of growth patterns, ease of collection and processing, and relative precision of age estimates were evaluated for each structure with data collected on skeletal structures and morphometric measurements of 147 individuals ranging in size from 31 to 224 cm total length. Various methods were used to elucidate growth zones (thin-sectioning, oil and water clearing, staining, and X-ray radiography) to determine the most useful ageing technique for each structure. All calcified structures contained concentric growth zones that increased in number with the size of the fish and were interpreted as annual events. There was a direct linear relationship between size of the structures and size of the fish. Pectoral fin sections were the most practical ageing structure in terms of ease of collection, processing, legibility, and precision of interpretation. Age estimates from other structures resulted in poor precision between readers but relatively good intrareader precision. This suggests possible corroborative use with the development of better interpretive criteria and elucidation techniques. The von Bertalanffy growth curve calculated from age estimates based on pectoral fin sections for all samples produced a growth model for white sturgeon that compared favorably with those from previous studies.},

  abstract = {Golden perch, Macquaria ambigua, from the Murray-Darling Basin were aged by using transverse thin sections of their sagittal otoliths. Samples from 889 fish were obtained from riverine and lacustrine habitats and from wild and stocked populations. Error in the precision of age estimates (calculated as the mean percentage error of the independent age estimates of four readers) was 5.6\% (3.9\% after allowing for discrepancies in relation to the annual mark on the edge of the otolith). Validation was accomplished by using a combination of analysis of the progression of modes in length-frequency distributions, qualitative and quantitative marginal-increment analysis, and analysis of age estimates of fish from populations with a known stocking history. The technique was validated for fish up to 8 years of age (455-545 mm total length, 1695-3988 g total weight), and the greatest recorded age was 16 years (530-600 mm total length, 2607-4050 g total weight). Annual marks become visible in otolith sections in most fish of all ages in October, and 1 October was designated as the birth date. A description of our method of reading sections of golden perch otoliths, including recognition of false annual marks, is given. Otolith length, width and thickness increased linearly with fish length and with loglo(fish age), whereas otolith weight increased linearly with fish age and exponentially with fish length. The continuous growth of the otoliths and the consistency in the appearance of annual marks support the accuracy of estimates up to the maximum recorded age. The mean length-at-age and the parameters of the length-weight relationship were estimated. The von Bertalanffy growth parameters were also estimated (L, =507 mm, to=O.420 years, K=O.454). No significant differences were found in growth rates or length-weight relationships between males and females. However, growth (particularly in weight) was highly variable among sites and years, and slow-growing 5-year-olds may be shorter than fastgrowing 1-year-olds. Ages were estimated for a sample of 86 golden perch caught between 1949 and 1951 but a comparison of growth rates between these and more recent collections was inconclusive.},

  abstract = {Estimating the age composition and recruitment of populations of invasive sea lampreys Petromyzon marinus necessitates the validation and improvement of age assessment methods that rely on statoliths and length-frequency data. Determining age based on length-frequency distributions is subjective because of heterogeneity in the growth rates of larval sea lampreys (ammocoetes) within and across streams and the resulting overlap in lengths between age-classes. Statolith-based age assessment methods have never been validated for more than 1 year. We established ``known-age'' ammocoete populations in two streams by introducing a single cohort of spawners above barriers and compared estimates of ammocoete age based on statoliths with the true ages. In five additional streams, we used microsatellite data from adults and ammocoetes to assign parents to ammocoetes produced the same year and compared the age determined by statolith-based interpretation with the age based on parentage assignment. We combined length-frequency data with age composition data from streams having known-age populations and evaluated likelihood-based statistical models used to estimate the age composition of the ammocoete population. Multiple independent age readings of statoliths from known-age sea lampreys indicated that the age assessment bias (average percent error) was 24.3\textendash{}36.2\%. Genotype-based ages differed from statolith-based ages in 36.1\% of cases across all streams. Bias-corrected statolith ages, when combined with length-frequency data, substantially increased age assessment accuracy in a known-age population stream and increased precision in a randomly selected stream; their use, however, requires knowledge of the magnitude of the bias of statolith-based age assessment in study streams. Further effort is needed to quantify these biases and generalize to different types of streams before a reliable methodology for age assessment will be available for sea lamprey management.},

In L. rohita and C. marulius percent agreement between reader's age estimates was highest for scales, i.e. 96.3\% and 90.5\%, respectively and in C. catla percent agreement was highest (93.3\%) for opercular bone.

In case of C. catla highest percent agreement was found between opercular bone and scale age estimates. In L. rohita each of the ageing structure showed significant (P $<$ 0.05) underestimation of age in comparison to scales. In C. catla mean age estimates from opercular bone were comparable (P $>$ 0.05) to the values obtained from all other structures except dorsal fin rays. In C. marulius mean age estimates from scales were comparable (P $>$ 0.05) to those from all other structures except from dorsal fin rays. Results indicated scales to be the most suitable structure for ageing L. rohita and C. marulius and opercular bone for C. catla.

Significant positive correlations were observed between the size of left and right statoliths from individuals. Principal components analysis indicated an allometric relationship between lamprey length and statolith size as well as a potential species grouping based on these measurements. Discriminant analysis was able to correctly classify more than 94\% of Pacific lampreys and 92\% of western brook lampreys based on lamprey length and statolith size, and Pacific lamprey statoliths tended to be larger than western brook lamprey statoliths for lampreys of a given size. Reader bias in age estimates of statoliths was greater for older lampreys. Multiple independent age readings of both statoliths from individual lampreys indicated that the overall average percent error was 16.7\% for Pacific lampreys and 33.0\% for western brook lampreys. Within-individual average percent error ranged from 5.1\% to 20.1\% among species and readers. Within-reader average percent error ranged from 6.4\% to 17.8\% among species and readers. The average percent error observed in this study was greater than that observed in studies of other species of lampreys; however, statoliths that were ambiguous or difficult to read were not excluded from this study. In general, the modal separation of age-groups observed in length-frequency distributions for lampreys is poor, as seen in this study; therefore, statolith-based ages may verify or provide better estimates of population age structure. These data demonstrate that estimates of precision are necessary before management actions founded on statolith-based age structure determination are implemented.},

The goal of this study was to compare three hard structures (scales, otoliths, and dorsal fin spines) for estimating the ages of yellow perch Perca flavescens in an unexploited population in a sanctuary of Pymatuning Reservoir, Pennsylvania. Scales, dorsal fin spines, and sagittal otoliths were removed from 107 yellow perch, prepared, and examined by two independent readers. Ages assigned by the two independent readers agreed 96\% of the time when using otoliths, 83\% when using scales, and 80\% when using spines. Pairwise comparisons (paired t-tests, $\alpha$ = 0.05) indicated no significant differences among the ages assigned using the three methods. Otoliths were the best structure to use for estimating yellow perch age based on high reader agreement and low coefficient of variation (CV). However, we found that scales and dorsal fin spines can be used to adequately describe the age structure of yellow perch populations (CV $<$ 10\% for each structure), although dorsal fin spines were slightly more precise than scales for fish assigned to age 4 or older by using otoliths. Thus, use of both dorsal fin spines and scales for yellow perch age and growth studies may improve the precision of population age structure estimates.},

Despite such a wide range, very little is known about most aspects of the biology of this species. Recent stock assessment studies in the northeast United States indicate that the biomass of the thorny skate is below the threshold levels mandated by the Sustainable Fisheries Act. In order to gain insight into the life history of this skate, we estimated age and growth for thorny skates, using vertebral band counts from 224 individuals ranging in size from 29 to 105 cm total length (TL). Age bias plots and the coefficient of variation indicated that our aging method represents a nonbiased and precise approach for the age assessment of A. radiata. Marginal increments were significantly different between months (KruskalWallis P$<$0.001); a distinct trend of increasing monthly increment growth began in August. Age-at-length data were used to determine the von Bertalanffy growth parameters for this population: L$\infty$ = 127 cm (TL) and k= 0.11 for males; L$\infty$ = 120 cm (TL) and k= 0.13 for females. The oldest age estimates obtained for the thorny skate were 16 years for both males and females, which corresponded to total lengths of 103 cm and 105 cm, respectively.},

However, little is known regarding the life history of this species despite its common occurrence as bycatch in several Bering Sea fisheries. This is the first study to focus on the age and growth of B. parmifera. From 2003 to 2005, more than one thousand specimens were collected by fisheries observers and on scientific groundfish surveys. Annual banding patterns in more than 500 thin sections of vertebral centra were examined for age determination. Caudal thorns were tested as a potentially non-lethal ageing structure. Annual band pair deposition was verified through edge and marginal increment analyses. A three-parameter von Bertalanffy growth function and a Gompertz growth function were fit to observed length-at-age data. Both models provided significant fits, although the Gompertz function best described the overall pattern of growth in both males and females, based upon statistical criteria and parameter estimates. Age and size at 50\% maturity were 9 years and 92 cm TL for males and 10 years and 93 cm TL for females. The maximum observed ages for males and females were 15 years and 17 years, respectively. Estimates of natural mortality (M) ranged from 0.14 to 0.28, and were based on published relationships between M and longevity, age at maturity, and the von Bertalanffy growth coefficient. Due to these life history characteristics and a lack of long-term species-specific stock data, a conservative management approach would be appropriate for B. parmifera.},

Age data contribute to this knowledge and provide critical information for the estimation of stock\textendash{}recruitment relationships, life-history parameters (e.g., mortality and growth rates), and lifetime reproductive potential. The estimation of age based on the second dorsal spine is subject to a variety of errors, including reader bias in the interpretation of which marks constitute annuli and how the structure is prepared. We estimated the precision of spiny dogfish Squalus acanthias ages by comparing age estimates made by four independent laboratories on a reference collection of 100 spines from spiny dogfish from Washington State waters. Personnel at each laboratory had been trained in the same manner and followed the same aging methodology. Age estimates were compared among laboratories and against the calculated median age estimation. Systematic differences in estimates of dogfish age among laboratories were found by graphical and statistical analysis. A coefficient of variation of 19\% represents the overall precision of age readings for spiny dogfish based on this study. This level of precision was associated with statistically different laboratory-specific growth curves; however, this relative bias did not always result in a statistical difference between parameters derived from age\textendash{}length relationships. Based on our results, an inter-laboratory study should be conducted to compare and resolve aging criteria before future, large-scale aging or population studies of dogfish are carried out.},

Von Bertalanffy growth parameters were calculated from the author's readings only, separately by sex, for D. eleginoides caught from waters south of New Zealand to the Ross Sea, Antarctica, by longline and trawl fisheries.

Several studies have assessed accuracy and precision of these structures; however, results have been conflicting. Additionally, information on processing times required to prepare and assign ages to these structures is lacking. Therefore, our objective was to assess bias, precision, and processing time of otoliths and pectoral spines used for age estimation of channel catfish. Otoliths (N = 603) and spines (N = 3,397) were collected from channel catfish during 2007\textendash{}2009 to assess bias and precision. A subsample of these structures was used to estimate and compare processing times. Otoliths displayed greater precision and less reader bias compared to pectoral spines. Age-specific bias was observed for pectoral spines in relation to otoliths, with pectoral spines greatly underestimating ages for age-11 and older channel catfish. Total processing time was greater for otoliths (12.26 min Ϯ 1.09 [SE]) compared to pectoral spines (11.01 min Ϯ 0.07 [SE]). These results provide managers with information to make decisions on which structure to use for age estimation of channel catfish given a known bias and precision desired for statistical analyses and amount of time allotted for the aging process.},

To validate this growth information, age was determined using the radioactive disequilibria of 210Pb and 226Ra in otolith cores from adult Pacific grenadier. Radiometric ages closely agreed with age estimates from counting growth increments, which confirms their annual periodicity. Radiometric results indicate the Pacific grenadier can live at least 55.8 years (\textendash{}7.4, +10.1 years). Growth increment counts from large fish indicate longevity may approach 73 years. Because the Pacific grenadier is long-lived and matures late in life, it may be vulnerable to heavy fishing pressure. Therefore, conservation measures need to be taken to sustain this rapidly developing fishery.},

  abstract = {The holocephalan, Chimaera monstrosa, constitutes 13\textendash{}15\% of the discards in deepwater trawlers operating off the West Coast of Ireland. Given the increased interest in the production of dietary supplements for human consumption derived from the liver oil of this species, a directed fishery has the potential to develop in areas of occurrence. In common with the majority of shelf slope and deepwater species, there is a paucity of biological and life history information available on this species. No information is available on the growth and maturation rates, with the closest comparative material being from commercially retained Callorhinchus species from New Zealand. A total of 62 specimens (10 male, 52 female) were collected non-randomly, by at-sea observers in the Rockall Trough and Faroe-Shetland Channel (ICES areas; 27 IVa, VIIb and VIIc) in August and October 2001 from the hauls of commercial fishing vessels. Specimens ranged in size from 26 cm to 74 cm pre-supra caudal fin length. The range of maturity was from juvenile to mature for both sexes. Dorsal fin spines were removed and serial cross-sections were used to establish the optimum position of section. Growth increments were counted in ground and polished transverse sections, and four readers conducted 3 independent readings of each section. The estimated ages ranged from 3 to 30 years and 4 to 26 years, for males and females, respectively. The von Bertalanffy growth parameters of Chimaera monstrosa were: L$\infty$ = 78.87 (cm), K = 0.0673 per year and t0 = -2.513 (yr). These parameters, together with the estimated ages, indicate that Chimaera monstrosa is a long lived, late maturing species. A significant relationship between the corrected total spine length and the estimated age was determined. As the removal of the dorsal fin spine is a simple technique, which does not decrease the commercial value of the fish, this method could provide a useful tool for the interim determination of age prior to confirmation by more detailed techniques.},

  abstract = {The age of Notolabrus fucicola from the east and southeast coasts of Tasmania was estimated from counts of opaque (transmitted light) growth zones in thin transverse sections of sagittal otoliths. The position of the first annulus was validated through the otolith radii of known-age juveniles. Marginal increment analysis was performed by examining the growing edge of otoliths over 2 years. This showed that opaque zones were formed annually and were consistently deposited from late September to early December (spring season), which is coincident with annual increases in somatic growth and water temperature during this season. A criterion was developed to ensure accurate age estimation for individuals sampled during the time of year when deposition of opaque material was incomplete or not apparent. The maximum age estimated was 20 years and the relationship between fork length and age was described by the von Bertalanffy growth function (L$\infty$ = 368 mm, K = 0.116 and t0 = -1.87 for males and L$\infty$ = 385.7 mm, K = 0.109 and t0 = -1.96 for females). The clarity of increment structure and rigorous validation protocol that was adopted minimised the risks associated with using marginal increment analysis to validate the periodicity of increment formation and it provided robust age and growth estimates for N. fucicola in Tasmanian waters.},

Large inter-regional size differences exist for this species and the few age and growth studies undertaken have revealed marked differences in life history traits for geographically distinct stocks. To facilitate the progression of further age and growth studies for this commercially important species, the effectiveness of caudal thorns as a rapid ageing tool was assessed. Twenty-eight male and 24 female thorny skates were collected off Greenland, covering the full size range of the species. Replicate age readings of crystal violet stained vertebral sagittal sections and whole silver nitrate stained caudal thorns revealed mean intra-reader age reading precision was higher for caudal thorns (Covariance (CV): reader 1 = 9.07, reader 2 = 9.73) than vertebrae (CV: reader 1 = 14.91, reader 2 = 14.27). Age bias plots revealed minimal inter-structure bias, apart from a higher average thorn age reading of 0.76 years from age classes 5\textendash{}11 years for reader 1. Minor inter-reader bias was evident for vertebrae only; averaging 0.90 years higher for reader 1 from age classes 11 to 15 years.

Since the early 1980s, we have used pectoral fin rays to estimate rainbow smelt ages, but the sectioning and mounting of fin rays are time and labor intensive. Our objective was to assess the feasibility of using otoliths rather than fin rays to estimate rainbow smelt ages. Three readers interpreted the ages of 172 rainbow smelt (60\textendash{}198 mm total length) based on thin sections of pectoral fin rays, whole otoliths with no preparation, and whole otoliths that had been cleared for 1 month in a 70:30 ethanol : glycerin solution. Bias was lower and precision was greater for fin rays than for otoliths; these results were consistent for comparisons within readers (first and second readings by one individual; three readers were used) and between readers (one reading for each reader within a pair). Both otolith methods appeared to misclassify age-1 rainbow smelt. Fin ray ages had the highest precision and provided the best approximation of age estimates inferred from the Lake Ontario population's length frequency distribution and from our understanding of this population.},

  abstract = {The age and growth dynamics of the spinner shark (Carcharhinus brevipinna) in the northwest Atlantic Ocean off the southeast United States and in the Gulf of Mexico were examined and four growth models were used to examine variation in the ability to fit size-at-age data. The von Bertalanffy growth model, an alternative equation of the von Bertalanffy growth model with a size-at-birth intercept, the Gompertz growth model, and a logistic model were fitted to sex-specific observed size-at-age data. Considering the statistical criteria (e.g., lowest mean square error [MSE], high coefficient-of-determination, and greatest level of significance) we desired for this study, the logistic model provided the best overall fit to the size-at-age data, whereas the von Bertalanffy growth model gave the worst. For ``biological validity,'' the von Bertalanffy model for female sharks provided estimates similar to those reported in other studies. However, the von Bertalanffy model was deemed inappropriate for describing the growth of male spinner sharks because estimates of theoretical maximum size (L$\infty$) indicated a size
much larger than that observed in the field. However, the growth coefficient (k= 0.14/yr) from the Gompertz model
provided an estimate most similar to that reported for other large coastal species. The analysis of growth for
spinner shark in the present study demonstrates the importance of fitting alternative models when standard
models fit the data poorly or when growth estimates do not appear to be realistic.},

Variability among age estimates by individual readers was low for both structures. Estimates using otoliths were significantly less variable than were estimates based on scales both among readers and among estimates by individual readers. Otoliths were more accurate than scales for estimating the correct age of fish. Back-calculated estimates of fish lengths at given ages based on otoliths were significantly less than those based on scales. Hatchery fish grew faster than wild fish at younger ages. Overall, growth of wild fish was slower than in other areas where Yellowstone cutthroat trout are endemic.

Scales and otoliths from each fish were aged independently by three experienced scale readers, none of whom had prior experience aging otoliths. The average percent error and coefficient of variation of the scale method was approximately seven times greater than for the otolith method, indicating a greater degree of precision for the otolith method. No differences were observed in back-calculated lengths derived from measurements obtained from the right versus left otolith. No significant differences in back-calculated lengths up to age 3 for a given year class sampled in successive years were observed for white crappies aged by the otolith method. These results indicate that age and growth data generated from the otolith method would be sufficiently consistent for biologists to recognize yearly trends in growth variations. Known-age white crappies, needed to verify the accuracy of the otolith technique, were unavailable. However, scales and otoliths were taken from 31 white crappies collected from the James River arm of Table Rock Lake, Missouri, in spring 1984. The scale method for aging white crappies in Missouri is considered to be accurate by the Missouri Department of Conservation. The ages of these fish, as determined by scales read in Missouri and otoliths aged in Oklahoma, were in agreement for 30 of the 31 fish sampled. The use of the otolith method for aging white crappies in Oklahoma is recommended over the scale method. Once field personnel become efficient in extracting otoliths, processing time in the field is only slightly greater than when taking scale samples. No elaborate preparation procedures are required because ages can be obtained from whole otoliths.},

However, routine age interpretation remains largely subjective. A reference collection of 300 red snapper otoliths was circulated among seven external laboratories in the Gulf of Mexico region to compare ages against our internal laboratory determinations. A precision benchmark of average percent error (APE; estimate of precision) $\leq$5\% has been suggested for moderately long-lived species such as red snapper. APE ranged from 2.5 to 6.0\% for six facilities with no apparent bias in estimates as age increased. One initial estimate was notably higher with an APE of 11.6\% and bias was evident. Beyond the need for initial training to recognize annulus patterns in decades-old fish, common differences between readers were related to interpretation of the otolith edge type and to interpretation of the first annulus. Precise measurement of annulus distances and identification of otolith edge patterns aided by light reflectivity measurements indicated that annual rates of transition from translucence to opacity were consistent. However, annual differences in the seasonal timing of otolith zone transition occurred on the order of a few months (this study and others). The degree of opacity varied in the first annulus, but the distance from the core to the distal edge of the first annulus was consistently around 1mm (mean=1.05mm; S.D.=0.11). By recognizing possible variations in these patterns and with use of periodic reader training and a reference collection, our expectation is that a 5\% APE precision target can be readily achieved and improved upon.},

Bluegills were assigned an identification number, weighed, and measured. Scales were removed at the tip of the pectoral fin, below the lateral line, and sagittal otoliths were removed from each fish. Scales were aged by South Dakota Department of Game, Fish and Parks personnel, while otoliths were aged at South Dakota State University. The Little Moreau population sample (N=45) was dominated by young fish; 91\% of the fish were ages 2-5 and only one exceeded age 6. Agreement between scale and otolith ages was very high; disagreements occurred for only five fish, and in all cases the age difference was one. The Lake Louise population sample (N=59) had a more extended age structure from 2-11, and 29\% of the fish were age 6 and older. We found high agreement between scale and otolith age assignments for ages 2-5; only three disagreements occurred for these 32 fish. However, scale ages were consistently lower than otolith ages for age-6 and older fish. In addition, scale ages were as much as 5 years lower than otolith ages for these older fish. Thus, scales provided age assignments similar to those from otoliths over the first 5 years. However, scale ages were consistently underestimated for older bluegills when compared with otolith ages.},

The accuracy of age estimates was examined independently by comparing radiocarbon values in the otolith region corresponding to the first year of growth against the south-western Pacific calibration curve. C. spectabilis is very long-lived, with males and females living to over 90 years of age. Growth modelling revealed a fast initial growth phase, terminating in an abrupt plateau near the asymptotic length. This species displays substantial sexual dimorphism in growth, with males growing to larger sizes than females.},

The maximum ages identified were 8 years from otoliths, 7 from scales, and 6 from length-frequency analysis with the computer program MIX. Ages assigned to scales and otoliths by two readers agreed 79 and 91\% of the time, respectively. Ages assigned to scales and otoliths taken from the same fish agreed only 74\% of the time. Ages determined from scale and otolith samples obtained from known-age white crappies disagreed because the scales had developed a false annulus. At age 1, but not at older ages, estimates of growth derived from otoliths were significantly (P s 0.05) higher than those derived from scales. Growth estimated from length-frequency modes was generally slower than that estimated from scales or otoliths, but it was significantly slower only at age 1. Unless length samples are obtained during the period of annulus formation, length modes probably will incorrectly estimate length at age. Despite discrepancies among age and growth estimates provided by the three methods, population statistics derived from estimates the methods provided were similar. We suggest that otoliths be used to estimate age and growth of white crappies. Alternatively, if the application allows for reduced accuracy, or if releasing fish alive is a major concern, the scale and length-frequency methods can provide age and growth data that yield population statistics sufficiently similar to those produced by otoliths to be useful in assessing fisheries.},

Age agreement between the two readers was 71\% for both scales and fin rays. Similarly, age agreement between scales and fin rays within readers was 68\% and 72\%.

Therefore, our objective was to use marginal increment analysis to validate annulus formation in pectoral fin rays of shovelnose sturgeon collected from the Missouri River. We also compared the precision of age estimates between two different readers. Marginal increment distance indicated that for most of the populations an opaque band was laid down in pectoral fin rays during the summer. However, opaque bands were formed throughout the year in some individuals, which could be problematic when using fin rays for age estimation. The agreement of age estimates by two readers for shovelnose sturgeon was only 18\%, and differences in ages between the two readers increased for older fish. The presence of split annuli, false annuli, spawning bands, imbedded rays, and deteriorating sections made individual growth rings difficult to separate. Our findings verified that opaque bands are formed annually during the summer in the pectoral fin rays of most shovelnose sturgeon, but some individuals form opaque bands during other times. Pectoral fin rays will probably continue to be the most practical method of age estimation in shovelnose sturgeon, but ages estimated by this method should be used with caution.},

The position of the initial fin ray annulus of swordfish was verified for the first time with the use of scanning electron micrographs of presumed daily growth increments present in the otoliths of juveniles. Fish growth through age 7 was validated by marginal increment analysis. Faster growth of females was confirmed, and the standard von Bertalanffy growth model was
identified as the most parsimonious for describing growth in length for fish greater than 60 cm EFL. The observed growth of three fish, a year-old in size when first caught and then recaptured from 364 to1490 days later, is consistent with modeled growth for fish of this size range. Our novel approach to verifying age and growth should increase confidence in conducting an age-structured stock assessment for swordfish in the North Pacific Ocean.},

  abstract = {Bighead carp were introduced into Arkansas in 1973 to improve water clarity in production ponds. Bighead carp subsequently escaped aquaculture facilities in the early 1980's and dispersed into the Mississippi and Missouri rivers. The first documentation of bighead carp reproduction in the Mississippi River system was in 1989. The population has increased in the Missouri River as is evident in their increased proportion in the commercial harvest since 1990. The effect of this exotic planktivore on native ecosystems of the U.S. has not been examined. Basic biological data on bighead carp Hypophthalmichthys nobilis in the Missouri River are needed to predict potential ecological problems and provide a foundation for manipulative studies. The objectives of this study were to assess age, growth, and gonadal characteristics of bighead carp in the Missouri River. Adult bighead carp in our sample varied from age 3 to age 7 and length varied from 475 to 1050 mm. There was a large variation in length at age, and overall bighead carp exhibited fast growth. For example, mean back-calculated length at age 3 was 556 mm. The sample was dominated by bighead carp from the 1994 year class. There was no difference in gonad development (i.e., gonadal somatic index, egg diameter) between winter and spring samples. Length of male bighead carp and GSI were not significantly correlated; however, females exhibited a positive linear relationship between length and GSI. In each ovary, egg diameter frequencies exhibited a bimodal distribution, indicating protracted spawning. Mean fecundity was 226 213, with a maximum fecundity of 769 964. Bighead carp in the Missouri River have similar life history characteristics to Asian and European populations. They have become well established in the Missouri River and it is likely that dispersal and population density will increase.},

  issn = {0090-0656},
  abstract = {Age and growth of the swordfish (Xiphias gladius) in Taiwan waters was studied from counts of growth bands on cross sections of the second ray of the first anal fin. Data on lower jaw fork length and weight, and samples of the anal fin of male and female swordfish were collected from three offshore and coastal tuna longline fishing ports on a monthly basis between September 1997 and March 1999. In total, 685 anal fins were collected and 627 of them (293 males and 334 females) were aged successfully. The lower jaw fork lengths of the aged individuals ranged from 83.4 to 246.6 cm for the females and from 83.3 to 206 cm for the males.

The radii of the fin rays and growth bands on the cross sections were measured under a dissecting microscope equipped with an image analysis system. Trends in the monthly marginal increment ratio indicated that growth bands formed once a year. Thus, the age of each fish was deter-mined from the number of visible growth bands. Two methods were used to estimate and compare the standard and the generalized von Bertalanffy growth parameters for both males and females. The nonlinear least square estimates of the generalized von Bertalanffy growth parameters in method II, in which a power function was used to describe the relationship between ray radius and LJFL, were recommended as most acceptable. There were significant differences in growth parameters between males and females. The growth parameters estimated for females were the following: asymptotic length (L$\infty$) = 300.66 cm, growth coefficient (K) = 0.040/yr, age at zero length (t0) = \textendash{}0.75 yr, and the fitted fourth parameter (m) = \textendash{}0.785.

Such data for northern-form Dolly Varden Salvelinus malma have been traditionally garnered using otoliths, despite little research investigating the consistency of this or alternative nonlethal techniques. To address these gaps, the precision of age determinations generated from scales, otoliths, and fin rays was examined for 126 amphidromous Dolly Varden collected from two Arctic rivers. Three independent readers, age-bias plots, coefficients of variation (CVs), and percent agreement (PA) were used to estimate bias and precision for among-reader, withinstructure comparisons and within-reader, among-structure comparisons. Among-reader, within-structure tests of CVs suggested that otoliths produced more precise age determinations than fin rays. Furthermore, the CV for scales was intermediate to and not significantly different from those for otoliths and fin rays. Agebias plots suggested that, scales consistently underestimated age relative to otoliths beginning at age 6. Underestimation was also apparent, but less distinct, within fin ray\textendash{}otolith and scale\textendash{}fin ray comparisons. Potential sources of error and management implications are discussed. Because scale and otolith ages exhibited little bias within cohorts younger than age 6, age may be determined nonlethally in these cohorts using scales; otoliths should be used otherwise.},

We used samples collected from carcasses of adult Chinook salmon Oncorhynchus tshawytscha that were tagged as juveniles to (1) compare accuracy and precision of ocean ages determined from scales and fin rays and (2) simulate the effects of aging errors on run reconstruction (assignment to migratory cohort) under two age composition scenarios. Scale age had an overall accuracy of 81.8\% and was biased high (v2 \textonequarter{} 8.67; P \textonequarter{} 0.014). Fin ray age had an overall accuracy of 98.6\% and was unbiased (v2 \textonequarter{} 2.00; P \textonequarter{} 0.34). Precision of fin ray readings was higher than that of scale readings (coefficient of variation \textonequarter{} 2.1\% versus 7.8\%, respectively). Accuracy of fin ray ages was greater than that of scale ages (Z \textonequarter{} 2.198; P \textonequarter{} 0.03). For two age composition scenarios, age classification errors were greatest when using scales and least when using fin rays. Aging errors inflated the size of weak cohorts in simulated run reconstructions. We showed how this can cause large errors in estimates of smolt-to-adult return rate when run strength and age composition vary among years. The amount of error associated with scale aging then becomes problematic for tracking the status of both threatened and healthy salmon stocks. Data based on fin ray readings provided the most accurate, unbiased estimates of age structure. Correction for methodological bias is important if age data are to be used in rigorous analyses.},

  abstract = {To combat the potential deleterious effects that Silver Carp Hypophthalmichthys molitrix have on native populations, management of this species is essential. Before developing population-level models, a determination of which aging structure for estimating the age of Silver Carp is needed. To our knowledge, no consensus has been reached on which structure should be used for estimating Silver Carp ages. We collected 120 Silver Carp from the Illinois, Mississippi, Missouri, and Ohio rivers via electrofishing to evaluate aging structures. Removal time, processing time, and discernible annuli were evaluated for scales, opercles, vertebrae, pectoral fin rays, postcleithra, and asterisci and lapilli otoliths. Asteriscus otolith, opercle and scale annuli were difficult to discern and not evaluated further. Total processing times for postcleithra (246.1 s) and lapilli (251.2 s) were the most time-efficient; pectoral fin rays and vertebrae were more time intensive. Between-reader precision and agreement rates resulted in lapilli being the most precise, followed by postcleithra, pectoral fin rays, and vertebrae. Comparisons of structures with lapilli revealed that pectoral fin rays exhibited 78\% agreement, 49\% agreement with postcleithra, and 53\% agreement for vertebrae. In terms of agreement $\pm$ 1 year to lapilli, pectoral fin ray, postcleithrum, and vertebra resulted in high agreement ($>$85\%). Age bias plots revealed that these discrepancies consistently underestimated ages compared with lapilli. Discrepancies may be attributed to erosion of the central lumen of fin rays and postcleithra, while locating the first annulus on vertebrae may have led to this disparity. Based on previous studies, evaluation of overall processing times, assessment of between-reader precision, between-reader agreement rates, and bias that may be involved with alternative structures, we recommend lapilli otoliths be used for estimating age of Silver Carp. Future efforts should focus on validating accuracy of lapilli for estimating Silver Carp ages.},

By thin-sectioning the opercula, we removed the dense bone, revealing previously obscured annuli. Using opercula collected from older fish in Labrador, Canada, we found that the dense bone overgrowth led to an overall age bias of 1 year. When samples were broken into groups based on sectioned ages, however, there were minimal differences in age between the two techniques for fish age 6 and younger and a 2-year age difference for fish estimated to be age 10 and older. To compare precision in locating annuli between the two techniques, we calculated coefficient of variation values among independent determinations. Both techniques demonstrated low variance, however, age determinations had greater variation with thin-sectioning than with whole opercula interpretations. Therefore, we conclude that care must be taken when making annulus determinations from thin-sectioning. Due to the presence of dense bone overgrowth, associated with the whole operculum technique, we conclude a combination of both techniques would provide the most thorough procedure for interpreting opercular age for such long-lived fish (30\textendash{}50 years).},

  abstract = {It has been well documented in previous research that otoliths are the preferred hard structure for estimating age in coregonids. However, the slower growth due to short growing seasons experienced by populations in the subarctic region of the boreal zone may alter the utility of alternative nonlethal structures for estimating age. We compared the three most commonly used age estimation structures (otoliths, pectoral fin rays, and scales) for Lake Whitefish Coregonus clupeaformis in a northern (above 50 N) population from Great Slave Lake. This study provides new perspectives regarding the use of different aging structures with fish populations typical of subarctic and arctic environments. Results of ANOVA showed that reader confidence, within-reader precision, and the age estimates themselves were all affected by age structure; reader confidence also varied with age-class. Reader confidence was highest for age estimates from otoliths, followed by pectoral fin rays and then scales. Similarly, within-reader precision (as measured by CVs) was highest for age estimates from otoliths, followed by scales and then pectoral fin ray sections. Pairwise comparisons between age estimates from otoliths and those from scales or pectoral fin rays indicated no significant differences when fish were younger than 10 years (scales) or 12 years (fin rays), suggesting that these nonlethal structures could be conservatively used to reliably estimate ages of younger ($<$10 years) and smaller ( 300 mm FL) Lake Whitefish. Of particular significance are the findings that (1) divergence between scale and otolith age estimates is delayed by 5\textendash{}6 years relative to more southerly populations; and (2) in contrast to examples from southern populations, fin rays do not offer a suitable nonlethal alternative for estimating ages of older Lake Whitefish ($>$11 years).},

We sought to understand the effects of this bias by comparing population metrics that were predicted using scale-derived and otolith-derived age data. We collected scales and otoliths from Largemouth Bass that were sampled during standard electrofishing surveys. The age of each fish was estimated independently by three separate readers using both scales and otoliths. We assessed the average coefficient of variation for scale-derived and otolithderived age estimates, examined the bias of scale-derived age estimates, and estimated von Bertalanffy growth model parameters by using ages estimated from scales and otoliths. These parameter estimates were used in yield-per-recruit simulations that predicted yield and the percentage of individuals in the cohort surviving to 380 mm (proportional size distribution [PSD] 380) or to 470 mm (PSD 470) at several levels of natural mortality and fishing mortality. Otolith-derived age estimates were more precise; scale-derived age estimates showed significant positive bias for fish younger than age 6 and significant negative bias for fish older than age 6. Von Bertalanffy parameter estimates were significantly different when using ages estimated from scales and those estimated from otoliths. Modeling indicated that estimates of yield and PSD 380 resulting from the two structures were similar. However, the use of scale-derived ages resulted in underestimating the impact of fishing mortality on PSD 470 by as much as five times at low levels of natural mortality and fishing mortality. Our estimates of precision and bias were similar to other comparisons of scales and otoliths, and the results of our yield-per-recruit simulations are likely generally applicable for Largemouth Bass management. Trophy fishing is a common management objective, and managers relying on scale-based age data could be less likely to adopt the restrictive harvest regulations that are critical for producing trophy Largemouth Bass.},

We tagged and released known age-1 Brown Trout with coded wire tags in spring 2010\textendash{}2015. Age-1 Brown Trout were identified by length and verified by identifying a single annulus in a subsample of otoliths. Brown Trout were recaptured 1 to 5 years after tagging to extract otoliths for aging and coded wire tags to identify known age. We used three readers to independently estimate age using otoliths for 249 Brown Trout, and we quantified bias and precision. Complete agreement (all readers assigned the same age) was 74\%, partial agreement (at least two readers assigned the same age) was 98\%, and consensus agreement with known age (all readers agreed on a consensus on age when assigned ages differed) was 93\% with a coefficient of variation of 9.4\%. Consensus agreement by age varied from 81\% for age 3 (n = 31) to 98\% for age 1 (n = 132) and 100\% for age 5 (n = 6).

However, there is limited information on the relative precision of estimates from these two structures. Thus, we analyzed the precision of age estimates derived from otoliths and the articulating process of the pectoral spine and compared the dynamic processes (recruitment, growth, and mortality) resulting from those estimates. Aging structures were removed from 110 channel catfish captured from the Wabash River (river kilometers 550\textendash{}9.6) via day\textendash{}time electrofishing. The age estimation methodologies were similar to those described in previous studies. Agreement between the ages derived from the two structures was high; the average percent error was 8.4\%, the coefficient of variation was 11.4, and the slope of the age bias plots did not differ from 1, indicating similar age assignments between structures. The corresponding recruitment patterns, von Bertalanffy growth models, and mortality rates did not differ between the aging structures. We conclude that the articulating process of the pectoral spine provides age assignments similar to those of otoliths and that the dynamic processes do not differ between structures. Further, based on the results of this study, the articulating process of the pectoral spine provides a suitable alternative to otoliths and has the advantage that channel catfish do not have to be sacrificed.},

Results showed that accuracy of age estimation methods varied among structures: 85.68\% of otoliths, 68.91\% of scales, 49.25\% of pectoral fin rays, and 27.67\% of opercular bones yielded age estimates that were consistent with the actual fish ages. Ages determined from other structures, such as interopercular bones, dorsal fins, basioccipital bones, and vertebrae, had lower rates of agreement ($<$20\%) with actual ages. The current results suggest that age estimation with otoliths, especially sagittal otoliths, is the most accurate method for use with Northern Snakeheads. Furthermore, analysis of scales can be used as a supplementary approach, especially for younger (age $<$ 3) Northern Snakeheads. Received March 14, 2013; accepted June 27, 2013},

  abstract = {An important component of effective fisheries management is estimating fish ages. Age estimates can be used to estimate recruitment, relative abundance of age-groups, total mortality, and growth. Because of difficulty in estimating Northern Pike Esox lucius ages using scales and whole cleithra, we compared precision and bias of age estimates from whole cleithra, sectioned cleithra, metapterygoid bones, otoliths, and scales. Metapterygoid bones and sectioned cleithra represent two novel structures for estimating ages in North America, and the assessment of otoliths is limited. Complete agreement and consensus agreement rates were greatest for otoliths, sectioned cleithra, and metapterygoid bones. Otoliths provided the most precise age estimates and whole cleithra were the least precise. Consensus age estimates for sectioned cleithra were lower than whole cleithrum estimates. Consensus age estimates from sectioned otoliths were lower than mean age estimates from scales, sectioned cleithra, and whole cleithra, and y-intercepts from the age-bias plots were significantly different than zero. We suggest that otoliths, sectioned cleithra, and metapterygoid bones can be used to estimate Northern Pike ages, but recommend the use of sectioned otoliths because they had the highest precision and otoliths have become a common means of estimating ages for many species.Received December 8, 2015; accepted March 31, 2016 Published online July 20, 2016},

The Saint John River, New Brunswick, and the St. Lawrence River, Quebec, support the two remaining commercial fisheries for Atlantic Sturgeon in North America; however, the relationship between age and growth has not previously been modeled for the Saint John River population. Ages of Saint John River Atlantic Sturgeon were estimated by using pectoral fin spine sections collected from 262 individuals of known TL. Most (87\%) of the pectoral spine sections were aged by two readers to evaluate possible reader bias. An age\textendash{}bias plot and coefficient of variation (CV) indicated relatively low between-reader precision (CV = 5.6\%) compared with that reported in other studies. Von Bertalanffy growth model (VBGM) parameters were estimated for males (n = 67), females (n = 85), and the combined sexes. Unsexed juveniles and subadults smaller than 150 cm TL (n = 110) were used for the lower part of each curve. The growth models indicated that (1) males reached maximum length sooner than females and (2) females continued to grow more as adults to greater lengths (males: Brody growth coefficient K = 0.06, asymptotic length L$\infty$ = 230 cm TL; females: K = 0.04, L$\infty$ = 264 cm TL). As predicted, the VBGM parameters estimated for combined sexes of the Saint John River stock (K = 0.05, L$\infty$ = 254 cm) were intermediate to those of Atlantic Sturgeon from the Hudson and St. Lawrence rivers, in agreement with a previously observed latitudinal trend in growth.Received June 26, 2014; accepted January 13, 2015},

  abstract = {Previous evaluations of calcified structures used to estimate fish ages have not included maxillae. While otoliths are considered the superior structure for assessing the age of Lake Trout Salvelinus namaycush, it can be difficult to collect and analyze sufficient samples for annual stock assessment, particularly from recreational fisheries. We used maxilla sections to estimate ages of 1,145 Lake Trout collected from Lake Huron in 2013, including 83 fish of known age with coded wire tags (CWT). Maxilla removal was 287\% faster than extraction of otoliths. Maxilla sections were cut using inexpensive tools commonly used for processing spines and fin rays. Multiple sections could be made easily from each maxilla, allowing for the use of a superior section that exhibited easily identifiable annuli; in contrast, a single cracked otolith yields only two opportunities to assign age since the cut must be made through the otolith focus. From blind estimates by two independent estimators, made without prior knowledge of the true CWT-derived ages and before the decision rules were fully developed, exact match of maxilla-based ages to the CWT-derived ages was 59\textendash{}67\%; agreements with a bias less than or equal to 1 year were 88\textendash{}89\%, and agreements with a bias less than or equal to 2 years were 94\textendash{}95\%. These measures were higher than those obtained using otoliths sampled from Lake Trout of the same CWT-derived ages. After analyzing the sources of errors and finalizing detailed decision rules, we found that all maxilla sections exhibited a full complement of annuli comparable with the true CWT-derived age, except for two samples affected by errors occurring during sample collection rather than during maxilla processing and interpretation.Received December 16, 2013; accepted December 12, 2014},

Previous studies on comparison of age estimation methods of walleyes Stizostedion vitreum have shown otoliths are the best method overall and that dorsal spine cross sections are a suitable alternative to scales, the most commonly used method. We compared ages estimated from scales, dorsal-spine cross sections, and otoliths for unexploited walleyes from Pymatuning Sanctuary, Pennsylvania. We collected these structures from fish sampled in trap nets during the spawning run in March and April 1997. Two readers independently examined these structures without knowledge of fish length or gender. Otoliths provided the best agreement between readers for both genders (94\% for females, 86\% for males) and dorsal-spine cross sections provided the poorest agreement (63\% of females, 62\% of males). Younger ages were estimated from scales than from spines, and this difference was greater for males than for females. Age estimates from both scales and dorsal spines agreed poorly with age estimates from otoliths for both sexes. Ages estimated from scales were consistently lower than ages estimated from otoliths, especially after age 4; differences between ages estimated from otoliths versus spines were inconsistent. We concluded that otoliths are the best method of age estimation for this population and that scales are the best alternative for fish less than 500 mm long. This research underscores the need to validate age estimates with fish of known age and to test multiple age estimation methods when beginning research on previously unstudied populations.},

To do this, we determined whether the coefficients of variation (CV = 100 $\cdot$ SD/mean) differed between age estimates of fish using the two techniques in the Missouri River and a portion of the Kansas River. We found that the CVs did not differ significantly between techniques. While reader agreement did not differ significantly, side illumination took one-half as much time as sectioning. In addition, side illumination displayed outer annuli on older fish better than sectioning and did not require an expensive low-speed saw, microscope slides, or a mounting medium for processing. We conclude that side illumination is the most time- and cost-efficient method for estimating sauger ages from spines.},

Scales have typically been used to estimate ages of Arctic grayling Thymallus arcticus in Alaska; however, the recapture of marked fish after several years at large has cast doubt on the accuracy of scale ages for this species. To validate age determinations from otoliths, we used oxytetracycline (OTC) to mark 102 Arctic grayling from the Eldorado River, Seward Peninsula, Alaska, during 1994 and 1995. Fish were tagged, fin-clipped, weighed, and injected with 25 mg of OTC/kg of body weight. Over the succeeding 4 years, 16 OTC-marked Arctic grayling were recaptured. Fluorescent marks were visible in thin-sectioned otoliths from 15 of the 16 recaptured fish, and annuli that were visible beyond the mark accurately recorded the passage of years between mark and recapture in all otoliths with OTC marks. Ages assigned from scales underestimated the otolith-assigned age by as much as 20 years. We assembled a larger data set of scale\textendash{}otolith pairs (n = 74) by combining data from sampling mortalities collected in nearby rivers during 1988\textendash{}1995 with data from this study. We used the Fisheries Analysis Simulation Tool (FAST 2.1) to estimate growth parameters, and we used an age bias plot and a simple population model to illustrate the mismanagement of Arctic grayling fisheries that could occur if scale ages are relied upon to describe stock structure. We recommend the use of otoliths as the standard of age determination in Arctic grayling populations until a nonlethal method (e.g., fin rays) can be validated for age determination in this species.},

Age and growth of North Pacific albacore (Thunnus alalunga) was assessed by examining annual growth increments in sagittal otoliths from 486 fish collected in different regions of the North Pacific Ocean. A wide size range of albacore (52\textendash{}128 cm fork length, FL) was collected in an attempt to incorporate size-at-age information over juvenile, sub-adult, and adult life history stages. Overall, ages ranged from 1 to 15 years, with the majority of fish between 2 and 4 years of age. Growth models fit otolith-based size-at-age well, and Akaike's Information Criterion corrected for small sample size indicated that the specialized von Bertalanffy (VB) model provided the best fit. The estimated biological parameters of the specialized VB model were L$\infty$ = 124.1 cm FL, K = 0.164 year-1, and t0 = -2.239. Daily ages were also determined and verified correct age-1 assignments for fish 55\textendash{}61 cm FL, with daily ages ranging from 378 to 505 days. In addition, dorsal fin spines and length frequency (LF) analysis were used to obtain estimates of size-at-age and corroborated results from otolith-based techniques. Modeling exercises resulted in nearly an order of magnitude difference in spawning stock biomass (SSB) when comparing growth parameters obtained from this study relative to previous stock assessment models of North Pacific albacore. Results suggest North Pacific albacore is a relatively long lived tuna species and provide updated biological parameters useful for future stock assessment models.},

In the present study, scales, dorsal fin-rays and dorsal spines were explored as potential non-lethal ageing alternatives for juvenile goliath grouper. Annulus marks were validated using marked-recaptured fish, oxytetracycline injections, and edge analysis. A subset of fish was sacrificed to compare the scale, spine and ray ages to otolith ages. A 40\% recapture rate provided a useful time series of in situ age and growth data. Scale and ray ages were unreliable, but dorsal spines demonstrated agreement with corresponding otolith ages. Annuli were best represented by translucent bands in spines, as opposed to opaque bands in otoliths. Spines were positively validated for periodicity of annulus formation. Annuli formed at different times of the year in spines than in otoliths. By correcting for this difference using a biological age method, better agreement between otolith and spine age was achieved. Dorsal spines are recommended as the primary method for ageing goliath grouper between the ages of 0 and 6 yr. This study illustrates the use of a non-lethal method to determine age of a protected species.},

  abstract = {This study investigated whether teeth and dorsal fin spines could be used as non-lethal methods of age estimation for a vulnerable and highly valued tropical fisheries species, coral trout Plectropomus leopardus. Age estimation of individuals from 2 to 9 years old revealed that dorsal spines represent an accurate ageing method (90\% agreement with otoliths) that was more precise [average per cent error (APE) = 4$\cdot$1, coefficient of variation (c.v.) = 5$\cdot$8\%] than otoliths (APE = 6$\cdot$2, c.v. = 8$\cdot$7\%). Of the three methods for age estimation (otoliths, dorsal spines and teeth), spines were the most time and cost efficient. An aquarium-based study also found that removing a dorsal spine or tooth did not affect survivorship or growth of P. leopardus. No annuli were visible in teeth despite taking transverse and longitudinal sections throughout the tooth and trialling several different laboratory methods. Although teeth may not be suitable for estimating age of P. leopardus, dorsal spines appear to be an acceptably accurate, precise and efficient method for non-lethal ageing of individuals from 2 to 9 years old in this tropical species.},

We sampled 4976 individuals, with length and weight data collected from 2000 to 2008. We analysed the ages of 535 sailfish, with their individual growth estimated by using two models. The first was the Schnute generalized-growth model and the second was the von Bertalanffy growth function. The parameters in each model and their confidence intervals (CI) were computed. The best candidate model was selected using Akaike's information criterion.

  abstract = {Southern Green Bay supports important fisheries for yellow perch Perca flavescens and valid estimates of age structure and growth are critical to effective management. Anal fin spines and scales are used by the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources for age estimation, but these structures may provide lower precision and accuracy than otoliths. The primary objective of our assessment was to determine if age estimates, among-reader precision, and mean back-calculated total lengths (TLs) at age differed among scales, anal fin spines, and otoliths. Ages estimated from anal fin spines were more precise than scale ages, were as precise as otolith-based ages, and generally agreed with consensus ages estimated from sectioned otoliths. Relationships between TL and radii of calcified structures were linear for scales, anal spines, and otoliths along two different transects. Mean back-calculated TLs were generally similar between intercept-corrected direct proportion (ICDP) and linear regression (LR) models, but otolith-based direct proportion models (no intercept correction) generally provided higher back-calculated mean TLs at ages 1 and 2 than ICDP and LR models. Mean back-calculated TLs at age estimated from whole otoliths were higher than estimates for other structures; but differences among anal fin spines, scales, and sectioned otoliths were $<$10 mm. Our results suggest biologists have little to gain by switching to otoliths when assessing age structure and growth for this fast-growing yellow perch population with relatively few fish $\geq$age 6, but additional analyses are warranted for slower-growing perch populations in the Great Lakes where older fish are more common.},

  abstract = {Background. Gymnocypris firmispinatus Wu et Wu, 1988 is a small fish with the maximum total length of 242 mm, which occurs only in the Jinsha River and its tributaries (China), at altitudes above 2000 m. Nowadays, G. firmispinatus had been placed in a dangerous situation, due to hydropower station and excessive fishing. However, attempts to develop an effective population management strategy have been obstructed by lack of basic biological information, especially for age estimation. As we known, sectioned otoliths provide the most precise age estimates of many Schizothoracinae fishes, vertebrae and opercular bones were also used for age determination of some fish species. This work aimed to assess the suitability of three calcified structures (otolith, vertebra, and opercular bone) for age estimation of G. firmispinatus. Materials and methods. The annulus characteristics of otolith, vertebra, and opercular bone were described. Annual periodicity was verified by marginal increment ratio (MIR) analysis in otoliths and edge analysis in vertebrae and opercular bones. Otoliths, vertebrae, and opercular bones were examined to determine which structure produced the most precise and accurate age estimates in G. firmispinatus, mainly by scoring for readability on a five-point scale and calculating the index of the mean percentage error (IMPE).
Results. Microscopically, otoliths and vertebrae showed a typical pattern of opaque-and translucent-zones, attributed to slow and fast growth periods. Annuli formed between March and May once a year in otoliths and vertebrae. Forty-four percent of the opercular bones were scored as unreadable. The value of IMPE between the two counts was lowest for otoliths (4.25\%), followed by vertebrae (6.21\%) and opercular bones (11.58\%). The IMPE value of vertebra vs. otolith was 11.05\%, while that of opercular bone vs. otolith was 23.03\%. Vertebrae and otoliths matched closely only for the first 4 years of life, while opercular bones appeared to underestimate the age of G. firmispinatus.
Conclusion. Annuli in the otoliths and vertebrae both formed once a year up to age 8, and otoliths would be the most precise structure for age determination in G. firmispinatus. Vertebrae and otoliths matched closely up to age 4, while opercular bones could not be used for age estimation for the species.},

Sections of otoliths were preferable for age determinations of pink ling, whereas whole otoliths were preferable for gemfish. Validation of the assigned age classes was not achieved. Petersen's length-frequency method was unsuccessful and marginal increment methods were unsuitable for the species studied. Growth of males and females did not differ significantly for either pink ling or gemfish. Both species had a relatively slow growth rate, had a moderately long life-span and could reach body lengths in excess of 1 m. Maximum ages of pink ling and gemfish were, respectively, 21 and 13 years. Mean length-at-age and the von Bertalanffy growth functions were estimated. For pink ling (all individuals combined), K = 0.095 and L$\infty$ = 135.5 cm. For gemfish the best estimates were K = 0.153 and L$\infty$ = 112.3 cm. Precision of age determinations made independently by two readers for pink ling and gemfish, respectively, was 65\% and 95\% within $\pm$1 annulus; average per cent error, respectively, was 4.7\% and 3.1\%. Paired t-tests on ages assigned to each species by the two readers indicated no significant difference between ages assigned to gemfish, but there was a significant, albeit unbiased, difference for ages assigned to pink ling.

However, ages generated using this method generally have poor precision and require estimation of missing growth bands in eroded spines, prompting a search for improved age determination methods. In the present study, spiny dogfish were aged using the historical spine method and a new method involving stained thin sections of vertebral centra. Results of an inter-laboratory exchange demonstrated the need for readers to calibrate ageing criteria with a reference collection before reading structures, a practice that yielded significant improvements in between-reader precision of spine band pair counts. After calibration, the primary readers examined the full sample set. The two structures yielded similar age estimates for younger animals, but centrum estimates were consistently younger than spine estimates after age-10. Although further work is necessary to fully explore potential reasons for the observed bias, such as centrum size and location within the vertebral column, at the present time centra are not a suitable alternative to dorsal fin spines for age determination of Pacific spiny dogfish .10 years of age.},

  abstract = {Background. Shark populations within the eastern Mediterranean are declining due to overfishing. Unfortunately, our knowledge on the biology of sharks and specifically dogfishes within eastern Mediterranean is extremely limited due to the lack of landings. Mustelus mustelus (Linnaeus, 1758) is one of such deficiently known cartilaginous fishes and the relevant information on its age and growth in the eastern Mediterranean is missing. The understanding of growth and reproductive behaviour is important for management and conservation of this species. The presently reported study was intended to determine age, growth, and some reproductive parameters of Mustelus mustelus collected in the Gulf of Iskenderun, the north-eastern Mediterranean Sea. Materials and methods. In this study, a total of 155 Mustelus mustelus were caught in the north-eastern Mediterranean Sea between March 2012 and October 2015. Fish age was determined based on band counts of sectioned vertebrae. The periodicity of band pair formation was examined using the marginal increment analysis. Growth parameters for all specimens were then determined by fitting the observed and the length-at-age data using the von Bertalanffy Growth Equation. The size and age at which 50\% of both sexes reached maturity was estimated by a logistic model for maximum likelihood process and the gonadosomatic index was determined.
Results. The total length and weight of the specimens examined ranged from 44.3 to 162.6\,cm and from 241.3 to 12 060\,g, respectively. The presently reported study provides new maximum lengths (162.6\,cm) for M. mustelus from the north-eastern Mediterranean. The fish studied represented age groups from 0 through 25. The observed sex ratio was 1 $\div$ 1.04 (females $\div$ males). Von Bertalanffy growth parameters were estimated to be L$\infty$\,=\,195.13\,cm, W$\infty$\,= \,20 060\,g, K\,=\,0.06, and t0 = -4.27 for all specimens. Length\textendash{}weight relation was found to be W = 0.0027L3.0054 (R2 = 0.98) and 95\% confidence intervals of b = 2.936\textendash{}3.075, t-test P $<$ 0.05. All studied specimens of M. mustelus represented isometric growth (b = 3). Condition factor ranged from 0.148 to 2.87 for females and from 0.103 to 1.024 for males. The length at 50\% maturity and the age at 50\% maturity were 109\,cm and 8 in females and 92\,cm and 7 in males, respectively. It was observed that mean GSI values were low in September and July, reaching a maximum in January to February.
Conclusion. The results of this study could give useful insight for management plans and conservation of M. mustelus in the Mediterranean coast of Turkey.},

  abstract = {Background. Bastard grunt, Pomadasys incisus (Bowdich, 1825), is reported as a well-established species in the Mediterranean Sea. Although bastard grunt has rapidly expanded its area of distribution in the Mediterranean, there is no information about its age and growth. The aim of this study was to provide data about growth, condition, and first sexual maturity of the species in order to contribute to a better management of its fishery. Materials and methods. A total of 515 specimens of bastard grunt were caught in the Gulf of Tunis. The age was determined from otoliths. Length\textendash{}weight relation, von Bertalanffy equation, and growth rate were employed to evaluate the fish growth. Also the condition factor and length at first sexual maturity were calculated.
Results. In the Gulf of Tunis population, females were significantly predominant and the overall sex ratio (M : F) reached the value of 1 : 2.17. The two sexes showed a positive allometric growth. The marginal increment analysis validated the annual deposition of one single annulus in the winter. Growth in (total) length (TL) was approximately 65\% during the first year of life. The von Bertalanffy growth equation was TL = 23.9 \texttimes{} (1 \textendash{} e\textendash{}0.186 \texttimes{} (t + 4.62)). The somatic condition of fish increased markedly during the late spring and summer. Length at first sexual maturity of the bastard grunt was 16.6 cm for males and 16.8 cm for females, which correspond to an age of about 2 years.
Conclusion. The rapid growth during the first year of life, the early maturity and the moderately short life cycle contribute to the relatively fast spreading of the species.},

  abstract = {Background. The small red scorpionfish, Scorpaena notata Rafinesque, 1810, appears as a bycatch of Portuguese fisheries. Bycatch species are likely to suffer the same declines as commercial species with which they co-occur but information on those species for Portuguese waters does not exist. In order to increase the knowledge for the Portuguese continental-shelf waters several aspects of the species growth were investigated. Materials and methods. Age and growth of Scorpaena notata from Portuguese continental-shelf waters were studied using 379 otoliths. A subsample of 70 otoliths, covering all length classes, was read by three of the authors to establish a reading and interpretation pattern. The von Bertalanffy growth model was fitted to sex-specific age\textendash{}length data. The likelihood ratio tests were used to evaluate the significance of differences on growth parameters between sexes and with the parameters estimated in different areas.
Results. Females dominated in smaller length classes while males prevailed in larger ones, although overall sex ratio did not deviate from 1 : 1. Females ranged from 10.5 to 18.8 cm total length (TL) and from 1 to 6 years; males ranged from 11.4 to 20.7 cm TL and from 1 to 7 years. The von Bertalanffy growth parameters estimated for the Portuguese shelf waters showed significant differences between sexes and were: L$\infty$ = 18.23 cm TL, k = 0.43yr\textendash{}1, t0 = \textendash{}0.99 yr for females and L$\infty$ = 21.17 cm TL, k = 0.28yr\textendash{}1 and t0 = \textendash{}1.73 yr for males. The age range found in the Portuguese shelf waters was similar to that found in the Balearic Islands but about half of that found for the Adriatic Sea. Significant differences between growth parameters from the Portuguese coast and those from the Balearic Islands and Adriatic Sea were found.
Conclusion. Estimates of L$\infty$ in the presently reported study were the highest but rather consistent with the maximum length given for the species.},

  abstract = {Background. Age determination is a basic step in understanding fish biology and dynamics of fish populations. The only available data on the age and growth of argentine, Argentina sphyraena Linnaeus, 1758, a noncommercially exploited species of the family Argentinidae, was published almost half a century ago. More recent reports are limited to general biological characteristics of A. sphyraena so the main goal of our study was to fill a gap by investigating age and growth of the eastern Adriatic population of this fish. Materials and methods. Samples of the argentine were collected in the eastern Adriatic Sea, during March 2011, using a bottom trawl. We analysed sagittal otolith morphology and morphometry; the age of each fish was determined from the number of growth zones on otoliths and relations between the observed otolith age and otolith morphometrics were constructed using a power model. Mean length-at-age was described using the von Bertalanffy growth model.
Results. Sagittal otoliths of Argentina sphyraena displayed alternating opaque and translucent zones. The maximum observed age was 3 years for both females and males. Females that were 2+ and 3+ years old were the most numerous in the sampled population. The estimated values of the von Bertalanffy growth model parameters were: L$\infty$ = 17.57 cm; k = 0.40 year\textendash{}1; t0 = \textendash{}1.39 years. The age of the argentine can be best predicted from the otolith thickness.
Conclusion. The maximum lengths and ages recorded in this study confirmed that in warmer southern latitudes, Argentina sphyraena attains a smaller maximum size. It should be emphasized that the presented model described the growth of fish ages 1\textendash{}3 and therefore is probably representative only for younger age groups of argentine.},

  abstract = {Background. The peacock wrasse, Symphodus tinca (Linnaeus, 1758), is a common Mediterranean fish and the most abundant labrid species on the eastern coast of Algeria. Its age and growth, however, have been poorly studied. Such data are essential for proper fisheries management. The aim of this study is to provide information on the age and growth of this wrasse species from the eastern Algeria based on two different methods of fish age determination. Materials and methods. Age and growth of Symphodus tinca were determined by examining otoliths and scales of the fish sampled between January and December 2011 on the eastern coast of Algeria. Otoliths and scales from 515 and 469 specimens, respectively, were used to determine the age using commonly accepted procedures.
Results. The age was successfully determined in 513 (99.61\%) otoliths (277 females, 209 males) and in 428 (91.25\%) scales (232 females, 173 males), representing age classes between 0+ and 5+ years (1+\textendash{}3+ years for females and 1+\textendash{}5+ years for males). The validity of the otolith and scale readings for estimating age and growth was supported by the back-calculation method. The success rate in reading otoliths and scales of Symphodus tinca was very high. The growth pattern is well described by the von Bertalanffy growth equation: from otoliths, L$\infty$ = 26.46 cm, k = 0.79, t0 = \textendash{}0.12 for females and L$\infty$ = 32.32 cm, k = 0.54, t0 = \textendash{}0.22 for males; from scales, L$\infty$ = 26.61 cm, k = 0.61, t0 = \textendash{}0.45 for females and L$\infty$ = 32.50 cm, k = 0.48, t0 = \textendash{}0.31 for males. Otolithometry and scalimetry gave very close results. The total lengths (TL) ranged from 4.9 to 31.3 cm, and eviscerated weight (We) from 1.38 to 400.65 g. The length\textendash{}weight relation showed an isometric growth for females (b = 3.01), and negative allometric growth for males (b = 2.86).
Conclusion. The age was estimated by otolith and scale reading for males and females where the two methods yielded the similar results. Although the otolith readings presented a better fit (99.61\%), scales could also be used with fairly good results (91.25\%). In the future, research on the growth of S. tinca either of these two methods can be used to save time. The scale method, however, is certainly the easiest.},

  abstract = {Background. Understanding the life history of a species is essential for fully understanding its role within an ecosystem. However, many of the fish species of high ecological value have not been studied due to their less prominent roles in local recreational and commercial fisheries in comparison to other targeted species. These valuable fishes are also important trophic linkages between small neritic fishes and large, economically valuable apex predators. This study describes for the first time the yearly age and growth patterns of three small tuna species inhabiting South Florida (USA) waters: blackfin tuna, Thunnus atlanticus (Lesson, 1831); little tunny, Euthynnus alletteratus (Rafinesque, 1810); and skipjack tuna, Katsuwonus pelamis (Linnaeus, 1758). Materials and methods. Tuna specimens were collected in two ways: via donations obtained from various fishing tournaments and charter captains in the areas of the Florida Straits as well as hook-and-line catches performed especially for this project. Age determination was based on sagittal otolith hyaline deposition patterns. Marginal increment analysis was used as an indirect validation method. Growth parameters were determined by comparison of the fish fork length and the hyaline band measurements.
Results. Two hyaline bands formed each year in all three species\textemdash{}one in winter and one in summer. The von Bertalanffy growth equation produced a growth rate for each species: blackfin tuna, L$\infty$ = 95.34 cm, K = 0.28, and t0 = \textendash{}1.53; little tunny, L$\infty$ = 77.93 cm, K = 0.69, and t0 = \textendash{}0.69; and skipjack tuna, L$\infty$ = 112.76 cm, K = 0.24, and t0 = \textendash{}1.70. Parameters of each resulting von Bertalanffy equation were compared among species showing that little tunny grew the fastest, but skipjack had the largest estimated size. Results were also compared with growth rates currently used in stock assessments by fisheries management organizations, such as the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas (ICCAT).
Conclusion. Sectioned otoliths indicate two bands a year for these three species in the Florida Straits. Results were comparable to other studies, with a similar finding of two bands per year in hard parts for these species. Further knowledge of these populations will aid in stock assessments for these species and the ongoing shift to ecosystem-based management plans.},
